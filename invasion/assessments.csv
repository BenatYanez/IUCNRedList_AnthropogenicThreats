1998432,191696,Allotoca goslinei,Extinct in the Wild,,2019,2018-03-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Given the fact, that <em>Allotoca goslinei&#160;</em>was the dominant fish (ca. 75% proportional abundance) at the last known location of the study by Helmus <em>et al. </em>(2009), and then decreased in numbers since about the year 2000, to a few individuals in 2004, and zero when the habitat was extensively sampled in 2005–2006, it can be inferred that the species has disappeared completely from the wild. <br/><br/>With no known location and no known wild population, but several captive populations in Europe, Mexico and the United States, the Banded Allotoca is assessed Extinct in the Wild.","Here is the habitat description from Smith and Miller (1987), slightly modified by Köck in 2018: ""At the type locality, the Río Potrero Grande flows through a steep-walled, twisting canyon of high gradient that is well shaded by willows (<em>Salix</em> spp.) and the canyon walls. The species was taken only from a quiet pool of clear to murky water, that was about 23 m long and 3.2-3.8 m wide, up to 1.2 m deep at the steeply shelving south bank and with a substrate of sand, silt, rocks and boulders. Filamentous algae were abundant, and there were small patches of floating vascular plants. In the dry season the current was slight to nil. This was the terminal pool before the creek emerged from the canyon and dropped precipitously to the Río Ameca. <em>Allotoca goslinei </em>was found primarily in shallow water (15-26 cm) underneath floating plants (water hyacinth, algae, and a <em>Nasturtium</em>-like plant) along the gradually sloping north side of the pool. The largest series came from beneath a single patch of floating plants about 3 m long and extending no more than 1 m into the pool. The water temperature during three visits were 16.4-20 °C from mid-day to late afternoon, mid February to early March. Other fishes taken in the same pool were a Catostomid, <em>Moxostoma mascotae</em> (now: <em>Moxostoma austrinum</em>), a Goodeid, <em>Allodontichthys</em> n. sp. (now: <em>Allodontichthys polylepis</em>) and a Poeciliid, <em>Poeciliopsis infans</em>. <em>Rana</em> sp. was also captured, including tagpoles and adults."" Wischnath (1993) additionally mentioned <em>Ilyodon furcidens</em> being a co-inhabitant. Based on the diet of related species, the Banded Allotoca was most likely feeding on small arthropods in the wild (Domínguez-Domínguez <em>et al.</em>&#160;2002, Doadrio and Domínguez-Domínguez 2004, Webb <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). <br/><br/>Schindler reported to Hieronimus  (Hieronimus 1995), that on his visit of the type location in 1988, the water looked very polluted and reminded him more on a sewer than on a pool. The water was turbid, with little visibility, and the fish were caught only incidentally, but all species mentioned by Smith and Miller (1987) were present. Following Hieronimus, the condition of the habitat might be caused by an extremely dry spring in 1988.","<em>Allotoca goslinei </em>was moderately common until the year 2000 at the type location in the Río Potrero Grande. About that year, non native and invasive Green Swordtails (<em>Xiphophorus hellerii</em>) occurred<em>,</em>&#160;which invaded the type locality between 2000 and 2004 and increased in abundance while&#160;<em>Allotoca goslinei </em>decreased in <em></em>abundance.<em> </em>The Swordtail<em> </em>is thought to have displaced&#160;<em>Allotoca goslinei</em>&#160;through competition for prey (Arthington 1989), since the stream habitat quality did not noticeably change (Helmus&#160;<em>et al. </em>2009 unpublished data). Both species likely competed for the same sort of prey (Arthington 1989). <em><br/></em>","Deduced from inconclusive surveys conducted by Helmus<em> et al.</em> in 2005 and 2006 (Helmus <em>et al. </em>2009), this species is likely extinct in nature. This can be decided due to the fact that in 2000&#160;<em>Alloctoca goslinei</em>&#160;was still the dominant fish at the type locality (ca. 75% proportional abundance), but in extensive samplings of the river five, six years later, no more specimens were found.

These are the only botanists to have provided any details as to the species likely habitat preferences. However, W.R.

Irrespective, the lowland and slope forests of Rarotonga, and especially those in the vicinity of Avarua and Arorangi are amongst the most heavily modified on the island as a result of deforestation for agriculture, roading, housing and plantation forestry.

The river has been degraded due to the construction of the La Vega Dam and it is suggested that habitat degradation may have been the cause of the extant endemic Goodeids now being confined to a small area at the headwaters of the river.

The island is a relatively flat shelf of pot-holed, karstic dolomite covered by sparse, shrubby vegetation (largely the result of 19th century mining operations) with a second, higher plateau with apparently natural savannas as well as areas cleared during the mining operations, interspersed with dense but stunted woodland dominated by four tree species: Short Leaf Fig (<em>Ficus populnea </em>var. <em>brevifolia</em>)<em>, </em>False Mastic (<em>Sideroxylon foetidissimum</em>)<em>, </em>Pigeon Plum (<em>Coccoloba diversifolia</em>)<em>, </em>and Poisonwood (<em>Metopium brownei</em>). Although iguanas probably occurred island-wide prior to their extinction, preferred habitat almost certainly consisted of rocky areas and savannas instead of the densely forested portions of the island. Because Navassa lacks beaches, nesting presumably occurred in pockets of mineralized phosphate that accumulated in potholes. The phosphate (which was commercially extracted during the period when the iguanas presumably became extinct) might have been either of marine or terrestrial origin: precipitates of seawater during periods of submergence or from fish digested by birds and deposited as guano, respectively.<br/><br/>Among the five specimens&#160;known for this iguana, the maximum snout-vent length is 42 cm for the largest male and 37.8 cm snout-vent length for the largest female (Powell 2000). Based on the morphology of similar species, this is probably far less than the maximum for this iguana.","Like other rock iguanas, the Navassa Rhinoceros Iguana was probably threatened by non-native predators, hunting for human consumption, and non-native competitors which destroyed the vegetation.

Soil erosion and extensive loss of habitat as a result of introduced herbivores have been blamed for the extinction of this snake. Introduced mammalian predators, principally rats, have been identified as the leading cause of historical declines elsewhere in Mauritius and are likely to have resulted in the loss of this species from the main island, likely in the mid-19th century.","Not much is known about this snake's ecology, but its morphology with a blunt snout and no neck suggests it was a sub-fossorial species (Vinson 1953, 1975). A snake suspected of being a burrowing boa was reported to quickly burrow into holes in the ground (Vinson 1953). Bullock (1977) reported that the individual caught in 1975 burrowed through loose soil and plant material with ease.&#160; It is thought that the boa would have lived primarily in the understorey of hardwood and palm-rich forests (Vinson 1953, Bullock 1977). Its specialized jaw morphology is similar to that of the keel-scaled boa (Frazzetta 1970, Cundall and Irish 1986, 1989) and suggests that it predated terrestrial lizards and ground nesting/burrowing seabird chicks, but maybe also lizard and bird eggs. Dissection of a female specimen at the Zoological Museum, Hamburg showed it to contain five eggs (Hallermann and Glaw 2006).<br/><br/>An individual collected in 1935 measured 85 cm in length; individuals caught in 1953 and 1967 both measured 95 cm in length (Vinson 1975) and the last individual caught in 1975 was 88 cm in length (Bullock 1977). The five museum specimens measure between 54 and 140 cm (Bauer and Günther 2004). Other specimens have been reported to be up to 180 cm in length (Vinson 1949). The dorsal colouration was light brown with small blackish spots, becoming larger and joining towards the posterior of the body, with vertical streaks on the side of the tail and the ventral colour of the snake was pinkish and marbled and tinged with black (Vinson 1975).","Historically, the bolyerid snakes underwent a rapid decline, because of human visitation and occupation of Mauritius from the 1500s that led to widespread habitat destruction and the introduction of non-native species. Introduced mammalian predators, particularly rats (Arnold 2000, Cheke and Hume 2008) and possibly cats (<em>Felis catus</em>) are thought to have been the main cause of initial declines and loss. Snakes that were encountered on the islands were also shot by early visitors (Cheke 1987, Cheke and Hume 2008). Once restricted to Round Island, introduced goats and rabbits denuded the island of much its vegetation and caused extensive loss of soil, thus removing the burrowing boas’ habitat and their likely reptile prey resources. It is also likely that habitat loss would have led to increased predation of juvenile burrowing boas by the endemic Telfair’s Skink <em>Leiolopisma telfairii</em>.","By 1881, the bolyerid snakes were restricted to Round Island, with rats having invaded Gunner’s Quoin (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em>) and Flat Island (<em>R. rattus</em>) (Cheke and Hume 2008). By the 1900s, the burrowing boa was extremely rare on Round Island with single encounters in 1935, 1953 and 1967, despite repeated searches between the latter two dates (Vinson 1975). The fourth and last individual was detected in August 1975 (Bullock 1977). The removal of goats (<em>Capra aegagrus hircus</em>) in 1979 and rabbits (<em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em>) in 1986 (Merton 1987), followed by the recovery and restoration of the island’s habitat occurred too late for the burrowing boa: despite extensive searches and a full time presence of conservation staff on Round Island since 2002, the snake has not been detected (Cole<em> et al.</em> 2018) and is considered to be extinct.",,"The Round Island Burrowing Boa was a Mauritian endemic known from Round Island (2.19 km<sup>2</sup>).&#160;The burrowing boa was thought to have occurred on mainland Mauritius, but it is uncertain whether sub-fossil vertebrae belong to this burrowing boa or the extant Keel-scaled Boa <em>Casarea dussumieri </em>(Arnold 1980). If the former, the species is likely to have become locally extinct on this island in the mid-1800s due to the invasion of introduced mammalian predators, particularly rats (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em> and<em> R. rattus</em>). Snakes of the size of the Round Island Burrowing Boa and Keel-scaled Boa were recorded on the offshore islets Gunner’s Quoin (0.70 km2) and Flat Island (2.53 km<sup>2</sup>) in the north until at least 1839 and Ile de la Passe (0.02 km2) in the southeast in the 1760s (Cheke 1987, Cheke and Hume 2008).

Its closest sister species, <em>Gongylomorphus bojerii</em> from Mauritius, is diurnal and inhabits most habitats on the island (Cole <em>et al</em>. 2009), including lowland forest, grassland, sparsely vegetated areas with creepers as ground cover, and bare rock with crevices and rock piles (M. Sanchez pers. comm. 2020). The Réunion species was probably found in dry forest in the west of the island and in coastal vegetation (Probst 1998). It was probably primarily insectivorous in common with its extant relatives (Probst 1998)","This species is extinct, and the most likely cause of its extinction is the introduction of the Southeast Asian Wolf Snake (<em>Lycodon capucinus</em>), a specialist feeder on lizards, to Réunion in the mid-19th century (Austin&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2009). The documented timing of this snake's establishment on both Réunion (by 1840, based on testimony taken in 1839 - Cheke 1987) and mainland Mauritius (before 1873 - Daruty de Grandpré 1883) coincides with the extinction of <em>Gongylomorphus </em>skinks on both islands.&#160;Musk Shews (<em>Suncus murinus</em>), have been observed preying on Mauritian <em>Gongylomorphus</em>&#160;(Cole 2011), and this invasive species probably contributed to the historical decline (M.

None of the three recognized <em>Leiolopisma </em>species is reported in historical accounts from Mauritius or Réunion, and it has been suggested that the extinction of the Mauritian species followed the introduction of rats to Mauritius (Arnold and Bour 2008). Probst (1998) and Arnold and Bour (2008) propose that this may also have been the case for <em>L. ceciliae</em>, which would date the species' extinction later than 1670 (when <em>Rattus rattus </em>was first reported from the island).

Historical accounts describe how they could rapidly change colour from the vibrant green to black (Vinson and Vinson 1969). The geckos were reported to measure 20 to 27 cm in total length (Vinson and Vinson 1969), with museum specimens ranging in size from 155 to 207 mm in total length, with snout to vent lengths of 85 to 108 mm (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Bour et al. 2014). The tooth morphology suggests that the species was primarily frugivorous (N. Arnold pers. obs. in Austin <em>et al. </em>2014). Historical accounts state that they consumed the fruit of palm trees, flies and other insects and had a liking for palms, but would venture into buildings, onto roofs and were very tame (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Austin <em>et al. </em>2014, Cheke and Hume 2008). Natural predators that were recorded by early visitors to Rodrigues consisted of the now extinct Rodrigues Night Heron (<em>Nycticorax megacephalus</em>) and Rodrigues Owl (<em>Mascarenotus murivorus</em>)&#160;(Vinson and Vinson 1969, Cheke and Hume 2008).","This gecko species is likely to have become extinct as a result of predation by introduced rats that were present on the main island by the late 1600s, and possibly cats introduced between 1725 and 1761 to control rat populations (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Cheke and Hume 2008). By the late 1800s, when the geckos were scarce or had already possibly become restricted to the islets, much of the forests had gone (Cheke and Hume 2008). It is therefore likely that habitat loss was a contributory factor, although when recorded in abundance on Ile aux Foux in the late 1700s, there was virtually no vegetation and the geckos would take refuge in rock crevices (Vinson and Vinson 1969).","This species is extinct. Only seven preserved specimens are known, six of which are in museums (Bour <em>et al</em>. 2014), in addition to numerous sub-fossil bones from approximately 100 individuals (Austin <em>et al</em>. 2004). The species survived for longer than other endemic lizards on Rodrigues, none of which are extant. Until 1795, it was still abundant on the main island and was probably found on several of the 21 offshore islets, but the only islet from which it was confirmed as being present is Ile aux Fous (0.33 ha), where it was recorded in great numbers by Pingré in 1761 (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Bour <em>et al.</em> 2014). In the late 1700s, Philibert Marragon observed that fewer geckos were encountered in winter compared to summer (Vinson and Vinson 1969). In 1874, they could not be found on the mainland and two specimens collected in 1884 were thought to have been from one of the islets (Vinson and Vinson 1969). The last two geckos - collected by Etienne Thirioux in 1917 - were also thought to have been from an islet (Vinson and Vinson 1969). Targeted surveys for a surviving populations on the mainland and islets were undertaken in the 1960s and again in 2013 without success (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Cole <em>et al</em>. 2013, Jean-Baptiste 2013).",,"This species was known only from Rodrigues, a remote, autonomous island within the territory of Mauritius, and at least one of its offshore islets.","There is no use of or trade in this species, which is extinct.",Terrestrial,"No conservation measures are possible for this species, which is extinct.

It was endemic to New Zealand, where it  was widely distributed in lowland rivers and streams throughout the  North and South Islands. It was abundant at the time of European settlement  in the 1860s, but population decline was noted by the late 1870s. The species' disappearance continued  rapidly and, by the 1920s the species was known to exist only in some  streams in the east Cape, Wairarapa and Otaki districts in the North  Island, and on the West Coast of the South Island. Even in these areas,  it had undergone significant rapid decline and specimens were rarely  encountered. In the early 1930s a specimen, possibly the last, was brought to  the British Museum, however, the origin and date of collection were not  noted. The New Zealand Grayling was an amphidromous species, which migrated up rivers in large shoals in late summer, spent the autumn  and early winter up-stream (perhaps spawning), then disappeared again  in early spring, presumably returning to the sea. It was an important fishery species to New Zealand's indigenous Maori and vast numbers were caught using a  variety of techniques including net, weir traps and drive fishing. The  roe of this species was also consumed. The demise of the New Zealand Grayling was possibly due to a combination of  factors including over-exploitation by early settlers, the deterioration  of the freshwater habitat through the clearance of forest cover  resulting in increased light penetration and raised water temperature  and the impact of invasive salmonids. Although it is unlikely that any targeted surveys to look for this species have occurred in the last couple of decades, drift diving (a widely conducted method to survey for trout) in clear lowland rivers (prime Grayling habitat) would be an ideal way to record this species, but there have been no sightings.","The New Zealand Grayling was an amphidromous species, inhabiting freshwater, brackish and marine environments, including rivers, streams, at the mouths of tributary streams and in quiet backwaters. Formerly, they migrated up rivers in large shoals in late summer, spent the autumn and early winter up-stream (perhaps spawning), then disappeared again in early spring, presumably returning to the sea. Spawning apparently occurred in freshwater streams and hatched larvae made their way downstream to the sea where they remained until maturity and returned to freshwater spawning areas (Baillie and Groombridge 1996, Radway-Allen 1949).","The extinction of this species was possibly due to a combination of factors including over-exploitation by early settlers, the deterioration of the freshwater habitat through the clearance of forest cover resulting in increased light penetration and raised water temperature and the impact of invasive salmonids (Baillie and Groombridge 1996, McDowall 2010).","This species&#160;was abundant at the time of European settlement in the 1860s, but population decline was noted by the late 1870s.

A total of 40 specimens were collected from the Horse Point area during the two Belgian expeditions from the Royal Museum for Central Africa in 1965-6 and 1967 (Brindle 1970). Live specimens were not found at any other sites at this time although they reported fragments of dead individuals from the south and east flanks of Flagstaff. There are a couple of unconfirmed records that the species was present after this time and it was thought to be declining. Two expeditions were conducted by Paul Pearce-Kelly from the London Zoo in 1988 and 1993, however, they failed to find any trace of the species. Recent intensive survey work in the 1990s and 2000s by Philip and Myrtle Ashmole failed to locate the species in this or nearby areas (Ashmole and Ashmole 2003). Howard Mendel from the Natural History Museum in London also failed to find it during a visit with the Ashmoles in 2005-6. The habitat at Horse Point has been degraded as far as this species is concerned since the time of the Belgian expeditions by the removal of nearly all surface stones, under which specimens were then found, for construction purposes. There has also been potential increased predator pressure from mice and rats, and probably also from invasive non-native predatory invertebrates including spiders and the centipede <em>Scolopendra morsitans</em>&#160;Linnaeus, 1758. The only possible evidence that this species may have persisted beyond the time of the Belgian expeditions has been the discovery of fragments of dead individuals. A sub-fossil forcep and ninth abdominal tergite was found with bird bones in 1995 near Prosperous Bay. Two further ninth abdominal tergites have been recovered since. The first was found under a discarded piece of equipment in the centre of Horse Point Plain in 2013; the second in a small area at the Millennium Forest in 2014 where some remaining surface rock is present. However, this second fragment was found in a concentration of invertebrate remains in the lair of a predatory spider.

It was terrestrial, climbed trees, and was present all over the island, which was at the time mostly covered by tropical moist forest. Lister (1888) noted that ""they generally keep to the ground, but are able to climb trees."" Andrews (1900), who apparently was more impressed by their climbing ability, said they ""ascend trees to a great height"" in pursuit of fruits and young shoots, and ""I have often seen them run up the trailing stems of the lianas, and, in fact, they can climb as well as a squirrel."" Little is known of their diet, except that they were fond of fruits and young shoots.<br/>Nothing more is known about the habitat and ecology of this species aside from what is contained in the following lines: ""In the daytime these rats live in holes among the roots of trees, in decaying logs, and shallow burrows. They seem to breed all the year round"" (Andrews 1900).","This species was still abundant in 1897-1898 while Andrews was on Christmas Island (Andrews 1900). By the time he returned to the island in 1908, he was confident that it and the other native rat species, <em>Rattus nativitatis</em>, were extinct (Andrews 1909). Andrews (1909) speculated that introduced Black Rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> had brought an epidemic disease to the island that wiped out both native rats. Nearly 100 years later, the mystery was finally solved by Wyatt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (2008), who used ancient DNA methods on samples from museum specimens of these rodents collected during the extinction window (AD 1888–1908), and showed that endemic rats collected prior to the introduction of Black Rats were devoid of evidence of a pathogenic trypanosome (carried by fleas hosted on recently-introduced Black Rats). <br/><br/>To Andrews, the disappearance of such an abundant animal in such a short time had to be due to disease because <em>R. rattus</em> was not present over the entire island. It was unreasonable therefore to assume that the native species had been out-competed by <em>R. rattus</em> all over the island (Andrews 1909). Two predators had been introduced to the island by 1908, cat and dog, but these were far too few to rid the island of the rats (Andrews 1900, 1909). Although Christmas Island had an increasing human settlement at Flying Fish Cove, roads now crossed the island, and there was active phosphate mining, there was still a lot of native forest and even collectively these human disturbances were unlikely to have caused significant declines in the populations of Maclear's Rat (Andrews 1909). Andrews (1909) also relates anecdotal information that a medical officer on the island, Dr. McDougal, recalled frequently seeing ""individuals of the native species of rats crawling about the paths in the daytime, apparently in a dying condition"" in 1902-1904. <br/><br/>Pickering and Norris (1996) report on documents concerning Maclear's Rat that were uncovered at Oxford University, and specimens from the Zoological Collections, University Museum, Oxford University and the University Museum of Zoology, Cambridge. The documents include notes for a lecture by K. R. Hanitsch who visited Christmas Island for five weeks in 1904 and was unable to locate either species of native rat. Dr. Durham, a pathologist, visited the island from November 1901 to March 1902 and reported in expedition reports that he was told that <em>R. rattus</em> had been introduced to the island in 1899 by the S.S. Hindustan. Durham also collected 19 rat specimens. Pickering and Norris (1996) note that some of these specimens were of <em>R. macleari</em>, <em>R. rattus</em>, and some of varying degrees of hybrid between <em>R. macleari</em> and <em>R. rattus</em>. Hybridisation between the two species, with the implication that <em>R. macleari</em> was genetically swamped by <em>R. rattus,</em> was put forward as a contributing factor in the demise of <em>R. macleari</em> (Pickering and Norris 1996). However, hybridisation between the two species is unlikely given the phylogenetic distance between them, and apparently re-examination of specimens confirms that each belongs to one or the other species (Musser and Carleton 2005; Aplin 2008). This is further supported by the molecular studies of Wyatt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (2008).<br/><br/>Because Durham collected specimens, some of which were <em>R. macleari</em>, in late 1901 and 1902, <em>R. macleari</em> must have become extinct after 1901. <br/><br/>McDougal was the last person to recall seeing native rats alive, albeit in the act of dying (Andrews 1909). These rats were probably <em>R. macleari</em> because <em>R. nativitatis</em> was the rarer of the two, as evidenced by the fact that Durham was unable to collect any specimens of <em>R. nativitatis</em> in 1901-1902. Andrews (1909) writes that McDougal's recollections are from 5-6 years before, but it is unclear whether he meant 5-6 years prior to his 1909 publication (putting the date at 1903-1904), or if it was 5-6 years prior to 1908 when Andrews was on Christmas Island (putting the date as 1902-1903 as Pickering and Norris (1996) interpret the anecdote). Because Hanitsch was unable to locate the species in 1904, it is likely that the species already had become extinct.<br/>Green (2014) further defined the date of introduction of black rats (and hence trypanosomes) (September 1900) and the extinction of <em>R. macleari </em>(between April 1904 and October 1904).","Maclear's Rat became extinct probably between 1902 and 1904. It was, however, abundant on Christmas Island at the close of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Lister visited the island in 1887 and said of Maclear's Rat, it ""abounds all over the island"" (Lister 1888). Andrews (1900) who was on the island for ten months, 1897-1898, noted that it was ""by far the commonest of the mammals found in the island; in every part I visited, it occurred in swarms. During the day nothing is to be seen of it, but soon after sunset numbers may be seen running about in all directions.""

Its short tail and robust hands and feet demonstrate that it was equipped for life as a fossorial species (Thomas 1888, Forsyth Major 1900). It is interesting, however, that its skull was described as ""particularly small, slender, and delicate"" (Thomas 1888).<br/><br/>In any case, the species was often seen in and around burrows, and, unlike <em>R. macleari</em>, it did not climb trees. Andrews (1900) summed up what he knew of the animal: ""They seem to live in small colonies in burrows, often among the roots of a tree, and occasionally several may be found living in the long, hollow trunk of a fallen and half-decayed sago-palm (<em>Arenga listeri</em>). The food consists of wild fruits, young shoots, and, I believe, the bark of some trees.""","This species was last recorded by Andrews from his 10 month stay on Christmas Island 1897-1898 (Andrews 1900). At that time, it already appeared to be in decline. Although the species was known from the settlement at Flying Fish Cove, Andrews never encountered them there and believed they were mainly confined to higher ground (Andrews 1900, 1909). In the hills, he described them as ""very numerous in places"", but less common than <em>R. macleari</em> (Andrews 1900). Andrews (1900) states that ""it is difficult to avoid the belief that the former species [<em>R. nativitatis</em>] is being supplanted by the latter [<em>R. macleari</em>] in spite of the abundance of food.""<br/><br/>By the time Andrews revisited the island in 1908, he was confident in pronouncing the species to be extinct (Andrews 1909). In 1904, Hanitsch visited the island hoping to collect specimens of the native rats, but was unable to locate either species (Pickering and Norris 1996; see account for <em>R. macleari</em> for further details). Durham visited the island in November of 1901 to March 1902 and collected <em>R. macleari</em> and <em>R. rattus</em>, but was unable to obtain <em>R. nativitatis</em>, despite offering a reward to the local inhabitants (Pickering and Norris 1996; see account for <em>R. macleari</em> for further details). Pickering and Norris (1996) note that Durham did not go far from Flying Fish Cove during his stay, thus he could well have missed <em>R. nativitatis</em>. However, Hanitsch's failure to obtain <em>R. nativitatis</em> in 1904 likely means that the species was extinct by this time. Andrews (1909) relates anecdotal information that a medical officer on the island, Dr. McDougal, recalled frequently seeing ""individuals of the native species of rats crawling about the paths in the daytime, apparently in a dying condition"" in 1902-1904, and these may have included <em>R. nativitatis</em>, but were likely to be <span style=""font-style: italic;"">R. macleari</span> (see account for <em>R. macleari</em> for further details). <br/><br/>The demise of the Bulldog Rat was certainly rapid, going from locally common to extinct in less than eight years. It is thought to have been the result of an epidemic disease brought to the island by introduced Black Rats <em>R. rattus</em> (Andrews 1909; Aplin 2008). Black Rats are thought to have been introduced to the island by the S.S. Hindustan in 1899 (Pickering and Norris 1996) - subsequently determined to be September 1900 by Green (2014).

The diet was mainly vegetarian, including leaves of chenopods, other semi-succulent shrubs and grasses, but also included invertebrates such as beetles and termites (Copley 1999).

Those of&#160; the Lesser Stick-nest Rat are fairly low-crowned, with quite sloping cusps and with the lophs in the lower molars forming a characteristic chevron pattern, all suggesting that the species fed on relatively high quality food, such as sandalwood nuts (whose shells are usually found in quite large numbers in their stick-nests). In contrast, the molars of the Greater Stick-nest Rat <em>L. conditor</em> are very high-crowned, with almost vertical cusps, suggesting that they fed on larger volumes of lower quality vegetation, such as saltbush, which was fairly abrasive, because old individuals in owl pellet accumulations have quite worn-down teeth (A. Baynes pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The construction of stick-nests shows that shelter was important; the nests probably provided an ameliorated microclimate and some protection from predators. A nest may have sheltered several individuals, with records of up to ten in a nest.<br/><br/>Radiocarbon dates of Stick-nest Rat nest-middens have revealed dates ranging from modern to 10,900 ± 90 BP (Pearson <em>et al</em>. 1999). Pearson and Dodson (1991), Pearson (1999) and Webeck and Pearson (2005) have studied Stick-nest Rat middens to document past changes in vegetation and climate in central Australia, while Pearson <em>et al</em>. (2001) have documented animal remains in the nest-middens.</p>","Predation by feral cats is considered the main cause of extinction. Cats had colonized the whole of Australia by the 1890s (Abbott 2002, 2008). The arrival of Red Foxes in range may have driven remnant subpopulations to extinction; high rabbit numbers led to high fox numbers. Habitat degradation, particularly in refuges during drought, caused by introduced herbivores (mainly rabbits and sheep) before and leading into severe drought conditions may have contributed to extinction. Morton (1990) and Copley (1999) have discussed the effects of introduced herbivores on this and other extinct mammals; Tunbridge (1991) described effects of sheep at the Flinders Ranges. Predation by indigenous predators, such as Dingoes and owls, in combination with habitat degradation by introduced herbivores was probably a minor threat on its own but possibly an enhanced threat when other threats were operating.","<p>Krefft (1866) reported Lesser Stick-nest Rats ‘in great numbers … on both sides of the Murray River’, i.e., New South Wales and Victoria). Many early explorers commented on the abundance and large size of stick-nests, including in northern areas where only this species of <em>Leporillus</em> has been recorded (Copley 1999). However, by the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, explorers and naturalists reported that it was rare. Western desert Aboriginal people reported that it disappeared at least 40 to 50 years prior to the mid-1980s (Burbidge <em>et al</em>. 1988). The decline happened from east to west and from south to north (Copley 1999).</p>",,"<p>Collation of available records from a variety of sources (Copley 1999), including the remains of stick nests and subfossil data (e.g. Watts and Eves 1976; Baynes and Johnson 1996; summarised in Copley 1999 and Burbidge <em>et al</em>. 2009) shows that it ranged though semi-arid and arid Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory, New South Wales and the far north-west of Victoria, although the distribution was probably patchy and dependent on there being suitable vegetation for food.<br/><br/>The distribution of stick-nest rats formed arcs along the south-eastern, southern and south-western boundaries of the arid zone, from western Victoria to North West Cape in Western Australia.&#160; The Lesser Stick-nest Rat occurred further inland from the arid zone boundary, reaching the MacDonnell Ranges and Uluru (Baynes and Baird 1992) and occurring in the Great Victoria and Gibson Deserts, but also extended further south-west, to Peak Charles and probably parts of the Western Australian wheatbelt (A.

It was last seen in 1990, and exhaustive surveys at the species' known sites and the only other adjacent site with suitable habitat at suitable elevations have failed to record the species in several decades. The species experienced drastic population declines, probably due to chytridiomycosis and habitat loss, and has apparently not recuperated.","This species lived on the ground along mountain streams in premontane and lower montane moist forest. It presumably bred by direct development, with eggs laid on land, similar to other species in the <em>Craugastor rugulosus</em>&#160;series&#160;(McCranie and Castaneda 2007). It was not though to have tolerated habitat disturbance.","Species of the <em>Craugastor rugulosus</em> group appear to have undergone dramatic declines between mid 1980s to early 1990s across Honduras, including within undisturbed habitat which is a strong indicator of chytrid-related declines (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). Chytridiomycosis is thought to have contributed to the extinction of this species (J. Townsend, L. Herrera and J. Kolby pers. comm. March 2019), as well as habitat loss and degradation caused by&#160;agricultural encroachment, wood extraction, forest fires, water pollution, and landslides.&#160;The type locality of this species was already within a disturbed area of human settlement (J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019). The second locality, Rio Arcaqual, is affected at lower elevations by a small dam that is undergoing increased use pressure by local communities; and if the species was still present, then it is thought that this would be a threat to it (L. Herrera, J. Townsend and H. Vega pers. comm. March 2019).<br/><br/>Highland amphibians are adapted to inhabit a narrow climatic envelope. Changes in climate are expected to reduce the available suitable habitat and required microclimates. Rapid shifts in the climatic conditions required by these species would not allow sufficient opportunity for adaptation, especially in light of the limited possibility for elevational migration. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Wicaksono<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017, Lyra&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017, Neate-Clegg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). An increase in high rainfall events is being observed throughout its range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) in the Caribbean, destroying the riparian habitat required by stream-dwelling and stream-associated amphibian species (Honduras Amphibian Red List Workshop March 2019). Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g.<em>&#160;</em>chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2006, Blaustein&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).","It had always been extremely rare, and is now considered to be extinct.

Some cultivated specimens have been replanted in semi-wild situations since the 1980s, but little or no recruitment has been observed except at one site.<br/><br/>The species was listed as ‘Critically Endangered C2a(i); D’ by Cairns-Wicks (2003). The transfer of status to ‘Extinct in the Wild’ is the result of the death of the last surviving individuals in the wild.</p>","<p>She Cabbage is a small tree, though it may reach 9 m in height under favourable conditions. Young plants produce very large leaves directly from the main stem, and typically grow extremely quickly; they are capable of reaching 2 m in little over a year. Growth slows at maturity and the tree becomes more branched with much smaller leaves. However, the life cycle is often very short, and many individuals start to display signs of senescence within a decade. Death usually occurs within 20 years.<br/><br/>This ephemeral phenology is characteristic of a ‘forest gap colonizer’, and it seems likely that the She Cabbage behaved<em> </em>as one: exploiting short-lived forest clearings, maturing and reproducing before becoming outcompeted by stronger species. Aside from conjecture however, there is no surviving description of the original habitat. Several tree species might have occurred in the mid-altitude belt, but the composition of the woodland around which the ‘gaps’ formed have not been determined.<br/><br/>Plants flower sporadically throughout much of the year but more so in the winter months. There is considerable variation in seed viability between individuals which suggests a degree of self-incompatibility, although the mechanism behind this is unknown. The achenes possess a pappus and are dispersed by the wind, but at some sites the majority are consumed by introduced bird species.<br/><br/>The unusually soft wood is prone to rapid decay and is host to several species of endemic wood-boring invertebrates. This xylophagous fauna is still poorly-known and its degree of overlap with other hosts is unclear. At least five species of beetle (Coloptera: Curculionidae/Anthribidae) and one moth (Tineidae: <em>Opogona</em> sp.) were present on the Osbourne’s trees and the impact of the loss on this potentially highly endangered micro-fauna is a major concern.</p>","<p>Deforestation was almost certainly the major cause of widespread decline in the She Cabbage. Following the establishment of a permanent colony on St Helena by the East India Company in 1658, the middle altitude zone of the island was rapidly cleared to make way for pasture and the native woodlands were felled for timber and fuel. By the mid 18<sup>th</sup> Century only small fragments remained, and these had vanished almost entirely by the early 1800s. The soft wood was probably not a major target for felling, but it would have undoubtedly been useful for stoking fires and strong timbers were occasionally used for joists.<br/><br/>Deprived of new colonization opportunities, short-lived gap species may be particularly vulnerable to extinction once reduced to small, isolated patches. Indeed, it is unlikely that She Cabbage could persist in the wild on St Helena today without extensive restoration of large tracks of forest to create a viable network of temporary glades. The problems of fragmentation have been further compounded by partial self-incompatibility.<br/><br/>The last natural locality at Osbourne’s has not provided particularly suitable habitat for this species since it was discovered. Surrounded on all sides by pasture, plants suffered considerable wind damage due to the lack of a surrounding canopy to shield them. Furthermore, without heavy shade, the understorey had a tendency to become densely in-filled with non-native grasses, which effectively prevented the light wind-blown seed from coming into contact with the ground.</p>","<p>From the 20<sup>th</sup> Century onwards, very few wild locations have been known.&#160;In the 1950s&#160;Norman Kerr encountered six individuals in Grape Vine Gut, but when these subsequently died the species was assumed to be extinct. In 1976, George Benjamin discovered a group of three mature trees along a hedge in pasture land near Osbourne’s Spring. With careful management, this colony increased to 35 individuals by 1995, and another site was discovered at Cole’s Rock (Cairns-Wicks, 2003). However, the latter was lost by the late 1990s, and the subpopulation at Osbourne’s dwindled alarmingly: to 7 individuals by 2003, 5 by 2007 and 2 by 2010. The last two survivors succumbed to gales in 2012.<br/><br/>A cultivated population has been established from seed collected at Osbourne’s, and there are currently several locations across St Helena where small stands have been planted. The most important are at Mount Pleasant, High Peak Cottage, Cason’s, Osbourne’s and Napoleon’s Tomb. Collectively, these sites contain close to 1,000 individuals.</p>",,"The She Cabbage Tree is endemic to St Helena, South Atlantic Ocean. It is no longer found in the wild but survives in cultivation in several places on the island.&#160;This distinctive tree appears to have been locally common until the early 19<sup>th</sup> Century. Roxburgh noted that “in the forests which decorate the south face of Sandy-bay ridge, it grows plentifully” (see Beatson 1816) and Burchell recorded it on the “road from Plantation House to Longwood in moist glens” (see Cronk 2002). This suggests a reasonably broad distribution in sheltered locations across St Helena’s upper mid-altitude zone, perhaps from 600 m to 750 m. As the remaining suitable habitat fragments were lost through progressive deforestation, the few surviving trees became increasingly confined to isolated localities near the species’ upper natural altitudinal limits, often where the range encroached the edges of preserved cloud forest vegetation. However, there is little evidence that this distinctive tree was a regular part of the cloud forest community, and recent plantings on Diana’s Peak Ridge and the windward face of High Peak have not fared particularly well.",Formerly used in building (roofing timbers of old houses like Mount Pleasant).,Terrestrial,"<p>Following agreement on a species action plan (Cairns-Wicks 2007), recovery work has now been sustained for several years. The efforts arrived just in time to avoid total extinction despite the demise of the wild population. Seed collected from Osbourne’s was sourced from several parents and there is no indication of acute inbreeding depression. However, considerable effort is required to maintain seed stocks because the large achenes do not tolerate long-term storage by standard methods and must be sown fresh. In addition, ripe achenes are produced only sporadically and must be collected very quickly before they are dispersed or predated. The fertility of a given plant probably depends on genetic factors relating to the individual and also to the spatial arrangement of potential nearby pollen donors. A number of ‘good seeders’ have emerged amongst the current parental generation, and the resultant increase in productivity has enabled several hundred daughter individuals to be propagated since 2012.<br/><br/>The original offspring from Osbourne’s and Grape Vine Gut provenances were planted widely and in small numbers around St Helena’s Central Ridge, but most of these specimens have now died. Such small, dispersed groupings proved to be difficult to tend and less likely to have high fertility. More recent efforts have therefore focused on planting in fewer but larger concentrations. Despite the reasonably healthy state of the recovery programme, the very short generation time of this species ensures that it is still in a very precarious state. The current cohort may not survive much more than a decade, and the risk of extinction remains high unless intensive collection and propagation work is continued.<br/><br/>Most of the recently-established She Cabbage plantations are functional seed orchards, designed for convenience. However, the oldest is a private restoration initiative in a semi-natural setting at Mt Pleasant. Here a thriving population has been created amongst mixed stands of endemics, with a graded-age structure. In this favourable habitat, plants naturally self-seed to a moderate degree despite patchy levels of viability, although none of the progeny has yet reached maturity (R. Cairns-Wicks pers. comm. 2014).</p>",Afrotropical,2012,false,false,Global

67371983,30560,Trochetiopsis erythroxylon,Extinct in the Wild,,2016,2015-06-16 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The last wild St Helena Redwood tree (<em>Trochetiopsis erythroxylon</em><span class=""authorship"">) died in the 1950s. Small numbers of cultivated specimens have been replanted in wild situations since the 1980s, but many of these have fared poorly and no recruitment has been observed.","Even the basic ecology of the Redwood is now difficult to reconstruct, presenting a considerable obstacle to further conservation. Roxburgh (see Beatson 1816) reported it to be a “middling-sized tree”. Plants today are slender, rarely exceed 3 m in height and usually do not survive for more than 20 years. It is quite possible that the typical growth form was stronger and more robust in the past, and the hard, red wood once used for construction purposes must have been harvested from much older specimens than those currently known (Cronk 1983). Flowering may occur throughout the year under favourable conditions, and the large, pendent blooms produce copious pollen and nectar. They are visited by a wide range on insects and are also self-fertile. Seed set is usually good but severe predation from mice (<em>Mus musculus</em>) occurs in many places. The seed is moderately large and heavy with no obvious means of dispersal, though it is possible that it was once taken and distributed by forest birds which have long since died-out.","<p>The extinction of the Redwood from natural habitats was, primarily, almost certainly a result of deforestation. Following the establishment of a permanent colony on St Helena by the East India Company in 1659, the middle altitude zone of the island was rapidly cleared to make way for pasture and the forests were felled for timber and fuel. Feral pigs (<em>Sus domesticus</em>), which were then prevalent on the island, were probably responsible for uprooting large numbers of seedlings. By the mid 18<sup>th</sup> Century only small fragments of the original native woodlands remained, and these had vanished almost entirely by the early 1800s. With the exception of a few preserved stands of Gumwood (<em>Commidendrum robustum </em><span class=""authorship"">(Roxb.) DC.), no descriptions have survived&#160; of the original vegetation of this zone. It is known that Redwood timber was much sought after and the bark was used for tanning.<br/><br/>Today, there are considerable challenges in preserving the remaining vestiges of the species. All extant individuals are derived from a single tree. This severe genetic bottleneck appears to have resulted in serious inbreeding depression, with many rearing attempts failing because the plants die as saplings or exhibit severely retarded growth. It is also possible that the Redwood<em> </em>once formed specific mycorrhizal associations which have now been lost, and this could also impair survival. The adults are susceptible to pests and diseases, particularly Vine Weevils (<em>Otiorhynchus sulcatus</em> Fabricius), and seed predation by mice (<em>Mus musculus</em>) is rife at some seed orchards. However, there is considerable variation in vigour between individuals, and small numbers grow into reasonably strong, shrubby trees exceeding two metres in height.</p>","Although a number of trees were present in gardens during the late 19<sup>th</sup> Century, the cultivated stock appears to have died-out and it is thought that the last wild tree at Peak Dale was the only surviving plant by 1950 (Cronk 2000). All extant specimens are now derived from seed collected from this individual. Cronk guessed that the cultivated population numbered around 60 plants in 2000, and it is likely that the total is approximately the same today.",,"The Redwood is endemic to St Helena, South Atlantic Ocean. It is no longer found in the wild but is cultivated in several places on the island.<br/><br/>Much uncertainty surrounds the original wild range of the species. Melliss (1875) reported wild trees at High Peak and Diana’s Peak, and since these locations hold the last fragments of indigenous cloud forest, it has often been assumed that the species belonged to this community. However, recent plantings in high altitude locations have not succeeded; repatriated individuals are vulnerable to strong winds and do not thrive in the very damp climate. It may therefore be significant that Melliss reported the plants to be found “in the glens”, perhaps instead suggesting a preference for the sub-montane belt between 550 and 700 m altitude. This zone appears to fit with the last known wild location, below High Peak at the head of Peak Dale Gut. Banks (1896) also asserted that they “refuse the highest ridges” and Roxburgh (see Beatson 1816) noted them “on moderately high hills”. On this assumption, it could be speculated that the range extended over parts of the upper mid-altitude zone of St Helena, particularly in sheltered valleys and on richer soils.",,Terrestrial,"<p>Experiments involving artificial selection have demonstrated that the health of the population can gradually be improved by careful manipulation (Rowe, 1995). Interspecific crosses between <em>T. erythroxylon</em> and the related Dwarf Ebony (<em>Trochetiopsis ebenus</em> Cronk) also produce fertile offspring with greatly increased vigour, and this could offer a possibility to accelerate the removal of deleterious alleles. A limited programme of back-crossing hybrids to <em>T. erythroxylon</em> parents has been conducted by Rebecca Cairns-Wicks. Thus far, F3 plants have been obtained, a few of which display very convincing redwood-like phenotypes, and maintain substantially increased growth rates (R. Cairns-Wicks pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>However, in order for such efforts to be successful, operations must be long-term and conducted on a much larger scale, as the small numbers of plants currently managed are very prone to accidental losses. In addition, it is important to preserve the genetic material from as many of the older plants as possible to avoid selective processes from further eroding the gene pool. Careful records of all crosses must be maintained so that genetic provenance can be traced.<br/><br/>A management plan has been produced (Cairns-Wick 2007), on which the above summary is based, but there are several barriers to achieving the goals. These include a lack of finances, local expertise, facilities and training. Furthermore, the short life cycle of today’s plants requires reasonably intensive efforts to replenish and increase the population. The situation is currently precarious: the ongoing programme is minimal, and&#160;periodic loss of trained staff and reallocation of budgets on St Helena could lead to further gaps, with serious consequences. As a safeguard against such problems, some seed has been placed in long-term storage, both on St Helena and at Kew's Millennium Seed Bank in the UK.</p>",Afrotropical,1950s,false,false,Global

Although it is thought to have inhabited the most remote parts of St Helena, the likelihood of this distinctive species remaining undiscovered on a small and well-botanized island is very low.","All known localities occur in areas which are now extremely barren and arid, typically in dry coastal valleys or on screes and hills near the sea, 0 – 200 m altitude. It is somewhat difficult today to understand how a tree species, reputed to develop a trunk up to one metre in diameter, could have thrived in such inhospitable places, especially since most Dombeyoideae species are adapted to reasonably moist habitats. One explanation is that the climate in the lower valleys may have changed substantially around the time of human arrival – a factor which could have contributed to the demise of the species. However, there is no obvious evidence to support this hypothesis. Alternatively, the very dense wood suggests that plants were extremely slow-growing, and this may indicate tolerance of extremely harsh conditions. The small, densely tomentose leaves also display a morphology typically adapted to minimize water loss.","The decline of the Ebony appears to have occurred soon after St Helena was discovered by the Portuguese fleet in 1502. It is highly likely that goat grazing played a major role in the demise. Goats (<em>Capra hircus</em>) were introduced by early ships to provide meat, and rapidly multiplied into large flocks which caused extensive damage to the vegetation of dry areas. A settlement was not established on St Helena until 1659, yet large stands of dead Ebony Trees were discovered in Sandy Bay within 20 years, and were felled soon after to fuel a nearby lime kiln. The exceptionally dense, black wood was potentially very valuable, but it seems likely that many of the remaining trees were carelessly harvested for crude timber or firewood, and the bark stripped as a tanning agent.","The last confirmed record was made by Banks and Solander in 1771 (Banks 1896). Roxburgh reported that a few plants survived until the early 19<sup>th</sup> Century (see Beatston 1816), though it seems likely that he did not see them personally.",,"The Ebony Tree was formerly known from dry lowland valleys and hill slopes of St Helena, South Atlantic Ocean. Very few botanical records were made before the 19<sup>th</sup> Century when the island had already been severely degraded by deforestation and grazing. We thus know little about the original flora, particularly those species which disappeared during the early phase of human impact. However, since the Ebony Tree was economically important it received occasional mentions in historical documents, and clues to its presence can still be found today in the form of fragments of semi-fossilized wood which still litter some of the drier seaward slopes.<br/><br/>From these indications, it appears that the species inhabited lowland areas of St Helena, especially along the south coast. Records have been made from Sandy Bay, Asses’ Ears, Devil’s Hole, Manati Bay, near Egg Island and Horse Pasture. Other possible locations include The Barn, High Knoll and Ebony Plain, but these are subject to potential confusion with the related Dwarf Ebony.",Fragments of ebony wood are still collected today.

Well under 1 km<sup>2</sup> of suitable habitat remains along St Helena’s Central Ridge and this has been searched extensively by botanists over recent decades.,"<p>Based on existing evidence, it appears that this species was an inhabitant of cloud forest around St Helena’s highest altitudes (above 750 m). The 20<sup>th</sup> Century specimen at Mt Actaeon grew in Tree Fern thicket (Cronk 2002), but it is also likely to have occurred in more mixed vegetation with other upland trees on steep slopes below the ridge crest. As the high altitude zone comprises the last vestiges of native forest on St Helena, there remains a possibility that the final individuals were relicts along the upper altitudinal edge of the former range and that the natural distribution would have extended to lower altitudes. However, the Olive certainly seemed to be a regular cloud forest species and a more natural member of this community than other postulated ‘transitional zone’ trees such as Redwood (<em>Trochetiopsis erythroxylon</em> (G.Forst.) Marais) and She Cabbage (<em>Lachanodes arborea</em> (Roxb.) B.Nord.).<br/><br/>The flowering period was variable but was probably mainly restricted to the winter months. The small blooms were mainly pollinated by hoverflies, and matured into dry capsules which took up to a year to ripen (Jackson 1991).</p>","<p>The majority of the population was probably lost to deforestation following the establishment of a permanent colony on St Helena by the East India Company in 1658. Trees were cleared for pasture land and also to provide fuel and timber, for which the hard, yellow wood was probably reasonably prized. Only fragments of the original mid-altitude forest cover remained by the mid 18<sup>th</sup> Century, and by the time of Melliss’s records in the late 1800s there was little native vegetation away from the highest elevations. Further extensive damage was inflicted in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century when large plantations of New Zealand flax (<em>Phormium tenax</em> J.R.Forst. &amp; G.Forst.) were established over the steep slopes of the Central Ridge, although it appears that the species was already close to extinction by this time.<br/><br/>Once severely reduced in numbers, small population size appears to have created further, inherent problems through low self-compatibility and perhaps also through inbreeding depression which may have reduced resilience to pests.

When George Benjamin discovered a single specimen near Mt Actaeon* in 1977 the species had not been seen for many years. This proved to be the last known wild specimen in existence. It died in 1994 but seedlings and a cutting had been propagated from it, and a few cultivated individuals continued the line.

It was only recorded from pristine rainforest where there was no disturbance. Males would call in summer along the edge of creeks and streams. It was one of only two known species to brood its offspring within its stomach. Females deposited their eggs, and then swallowed them. While in the stomach, tadpoles excreted some form of enzyme that inhibited the female's gastric digestion, and then proceeded to develop into fully formed froglets. The froglets were then regurgitated through the female's mouth.","The cause(s) of the population decline remain unknown. McDonald (1990) found no obvious evidence that seasonal rarity, over-collecting, predation, drought, floods, habitat destruction, disease, heavy parasite loads or stress due to handling for data collection were responsible for the population declines. Threats to the Eungella National Park include fires that might sweep up the slopes of the mountain during harvesting of the sugar cane in the fields below (Winter and McDonald 1986). Successive fires extend deeper into the rainforest leaving grassy ridges that are devoid of trees (Winter and McDonald 1986). The rainforest is extremely narrow in places and continual fire might eventually erode away entire sections of the forest or fragment the forest (Winter and McDonald 1986). Weeds that encroach on the edges of the forest pose a similar threat (Winter and McDonald 1986). It was thought that it might have been possible that the decline that was observed in 1984–1985 was a natural population fluctuation and that residual individuals had retreated to hidden refuges (Winter and McDonald 1986; McDonald 1990). The extent of such population fluctuations is unknown, but there is evidence of large swings in numbers of other Australian frogs (McDonald 1990).

78430533,19475,Rheobatrachus silus,Extinct,,2022,2021-02-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Extinct because it has not been recorded in the wild since 1981 and the last individual in a laboratory died in 1983. This species experienced a very rapid decline in the wild, from being common to extinct in just a few years, most likely due to chytridiomycosis. Extensive searches in the following 25 years failed to locate this species. There are fewer targeted searches for this species now that considerable time has passed since an individual was last seen in the wild.","This species lived in rainforest, wet sclerophyll forest and riverine gallery open forest at 350 m asl and was closely associated with watercourses and adjacent rock pools and soaks (Czechura 1991, Meyer <em>et al.</em> 2001). These streams are mostly perennial, but in extremely dry years they may cease to flow (Ingram 1983). The vegetation along the stream banks is usually closed forest or tall closed forest with emergent eucalypts, although there are some sites in open forest with grassy ground cover (Ingram 1983). In spring and summer individuals were usually found in or at the edge of rock pools, either amongst leaf-litter, under and between stones or in crevices around the edge (Ingram 1983). The species was also found under rock in shallow water in backwaters and also the main flow of permanent watercourses (Ingram 1983, Czechura 1991). <br/><br/>Searches of popular sites in winter only recovered two frogs and it is assumed that the species hibernated in deep crevices in rocks or spaces between rocks underwater during the colder months (Ingram 1983). Adult males tended to prefer deeper pools, whereas females and juveniles may have moved to newly created pools after rain as long as these pools contained stones and/or leaf-litter (Ingram 1983). The prerequisite for the use of pools by this species seemed to be that the pool must be deep enough for the frog to be able to sit with its head out of the water and be able to safely submerge (Ingram 1983). Individuals would only sit fully exposed on the rocks during light rain (Ingram 1983). The species&#160;was never recorded from cleared riparian habitat.<br/><br/>Breeding activity occurred between October and December (Ingram 1983). Males called from rock crevices above pools (Ingram 1983). Females brood young within their stomach and gave birth through the mouth (Tyler and Carter 1982). Fertilized eggs or early stage larvae were presumably swallowed by the female and completed their development in the stomach (Tyler and Carter 1982). The number of eggs in gravid females (approximately 40) exceeded the number of juveniles found to occur in the stomach (21–26) (Tyler 1989). It is not known whether or not the excess eggs were digested by the female or whether or not they were simply not swallowed (Tyler 1989). The production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach of the female ceased during brooding (Tyler <em>et al.</em> 1983). Tadpoles developed in a manner similar to the aquatic tadpoles of other species though, as they fed off egg yolk, the labial teeth were absent and the intestines formed at a later stage of development (Tyler 1989). After 6–7 weeks the females gave birth to up to 25 young (Tyler and Davies 1983a). Young emerged from the female’s mouth as fully formed frogs and after four days the digestive tract returned to normal and the female recommenced feeding (Tyler and Davies 1983b). Ingram (1983) reported minimum brooding periods from two individuals of 36 and 43 days and suggested that the duration was such that females were unlikely to breed twice in one season.","The reason(s) for the disappearance of this species remains unknown (Tyler and Davies 1985). Populations were present in logged catchments between 1972 and 1979. Although the species persisted in the streams during these activities, the effects of timber harvesting on this aquatic species were never investigated. Its habitat is currently threatened by feral pigs, invasion of weeds (especially Mistflower <em>Ageratina riparia</em>), and altered flow and water quality due to upstream disturbances (Hines <em>et al. </em>1999). However, from what is known from similar declines and disappearances elsewhere in the world, the disease chytridiomycosis must be suspected.","When first discovered, this species was extremely abundant and common. The species declined rapidly and disappeared at about the same time as a sympatric species <em>Taudactylus diurnus</em> (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Czechura and Ingram (1990) and Ingram (1990) state that the last frog was seen in the wild in 1979 on the Conondale Range. However, Richards <em>et al.</em> (1993) reported the existence of a specimen taken from the Blackall Range in September 1981. Despite intensive searching, the species has not been located since (Ingram and McDonald 1993, Hines <em>et al.</em> 1999). In the laboratory, the last known individual died in November 1983 (Tyler and Davies 1985b). Ingram (1983) studied a population of the species in the headwaters of Booloumba Creek, Conondale Range, and estimated that approximately 78 were present in 1976. No other estimates of population size are available for the species. This species is believed to be extinct.",,"This Australian endemic species was restricted to elevations between 350 and 800 m asl in the Blackall and Conondale Ranges in southeast Queensland (Hines <em>et al</em>. 1999) with a geographic distribution of less than 1,400 km<sup>2</sup> (map in Hines<em> et al</em>. 1999).

This species experienced very rapid declines, from being relatively common to extinct at each known locality within just a year or so, most likely due to chytridiomycosis.","This species was a rainforest specialist, endemic to the Wet Tropics Bioregion (Williams and Hero 1998, 2001), and found in upland rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest along fast-flowing streams where there is white water from riffles and cascades (Liem 1974, McDonald 1992). It was usually found perched on rocks or overhanging vegetation adjacent to the water (Liem 1974). Little is known about the life history of this species. Mating calls were heard from October to March (Liem 1974). From 86–90 large unpigmented eggs (1.9–2.5mm diameter) were laid under rocks in riffles (Richards 1993, Hero and Fickling 1996). Richards (1992) described the tadpole and noted that it was one of the few species of tadpole known to exhibit adaptations to torrent environments of Australia, including a streamlined body shape, large suctorial mouthparts and muscular tail. Tadpoles commonly overwintered in upland streams, although those hatching in early summer could metamorphose before the next autumn (Richards 1992).","This species is one of seven frogs occurring in upland rainforest streams in northeastern Queensland that experienced substantial range contractions and population declines between 1988 and late 1994 (Ingram and McDonald 1993, Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993, Northern Queensland Threatened Frogs Recovery Team 2001). These species share the common characteristics of having a high degree of habitat specialisation, and reproduction in fast flowing streams (Williams and Hero 1998). The declines are believed to be caused by the amphibian chytrid fungus (<em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>) (Northern Queensland Threatened Frogs Recovery Team 2001) although dead or dying individuals of this species specifically were not found (Berger <em>et al. </em>1999).<br/><br/>Richard <em>et al.</em> (1993) rejected drought, floods, habitat destruction, or pollution by pesticides, inorganic ions or heavy metals as possible causes of the decline. The habitat of the species in the Wet Tropics has been protected since 1988; therefore, habitat destruction as a result of logging was no longer a threat (McDonald and Alford 1999). Feral pigs were a potential cause of riparian habitat damage and adult frog mortality (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993). The activity of feral pigs has been recorded to have increased over the period 1989–1992 in an area previously inhabited by this species (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993).","This species was once moderately common in suitable habitat, but then experienced a catastrophic decline. Adults were last recorded in April 1990, and tadpoles and metamorphs were last recorded in November 1990 on the Carbine Tableland (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993). However, this species had apparently disappeared from sites on the Atherton Tableland much earlier (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993). It was recorded from various sites on the Atherton Tableland prior to 1973 (Liem 1974), but was not encountered in Danbulla State Forest during 1989–1992 or at any Atherton Tableland site during surveys conducted between 1991 and 1992 (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993). Surveys in the Wet Tropics conducted in 1991−1992, 1993 and 2011−2013 failed to locate the species from a number of historic locations and other potentially suitable habitat (Ingram and McDonald 1993, Richards <em>et al. </em>1993, Trenerry <em>et al.</em> 1994, Hoskin and Puschendorf 2014), and Hoskin and Puschendorf (2014) concluded that the Mountain Mistfrog could be considered extinct. The Conservation Advice published for this species summarises the extensive survey efforts from 1989 to 2013 that were unsuccessful in locating any extant populations (Threatened Species Scientific Committee 2019).

The species was seen on rocks during the day near swift-flowing streams or in the rainforest leaf-litter during wet weather (McDonald 1992). Males called during the day, from first light to early evening, near rainforest streams from beneath rocks or leaves (McDonald 1992). Males appeared to establish territories, possibly as a response to seemingly low numbers of females (Dennis 1982). Breeding was observed from late November through to January (Liem and Hosmer 1973). Eggs were laid as a gelatinous clump of about 25–40 eggs (2.2–2.7mm diameter) amongst rocks in the water usually in heavily shaded locations (Liem and Hosmer 1973). Liem and Hosmer (1973) described the tadpole of the species as lotic benthic. Tadpoles generally inhabited debris in pools or slow flowing sections of streams (Liem and Hosmer 1973).","Richards <em>et al.</em> (1993) found no obvious evidence that drought, floods, habitat destruction or pollution by pesticides, inorganic ions or heavy metals were responsible for the population declines seen in this species. Big Tableland, the area where the species was at its highest density in 1991–1992, has been mined since 1887 and logging ceased in that area in 1963 (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993). Rather, research suggests the rapid, catastrophic decline of this species was due to infection with chytridiomycosis (Berger<em> et al. </em>1999, Schloegel <em>et al.</em> 2006).&#160;Chytrid fungus has been identified on specimens of this species from the Carbine Tableland and Big Tableland (Speare and Berger 2000).<br/><br/>Feral pigs are a potential cause of riparian habitat damage and adult frog mortality (Richards&#160;<em>et al.</em> 1993). The activity of feral pigs has been recorded to have increased over the period 1989–1992 in an area previously inhabited by this species (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993). There is very little research, however, into the impact of feral pigs on native frog populations (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993).","Formerly a conspicuous inhabitant of upland rainforest streams because of its diurnal habits and historical abundance, the species started disappearing in the southern part of its range in 1988 and had disappeared from south of the Daintree River by 1992 (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993). In the past the species was considered locally abundant and in 1989, 48 calling males were recorded along a 100 m stream transect (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993). When surveys of the same site were undertaken in 1990, only one adult and several tadpoles were located (Richards<em> et al.</em> 1993). The rapid decline of this species is well documented and, in approximately five years from 1988 to 1993, it disappeared from an area spanning about 2.5 degrees latitude (Ingram 1993). Possible sightings of a single individual in a small tributary of the South Johnstone River in 1996 (Marshall 1998), and in 1997, a gravid female seen near Mount Hartley (Hero <em>et al.</em> 1998), are the only records of the species since 1994 (Hero <em>et al.</em> 2002, Schloegel <em>et al.</em> 2006).

Introductions of exotic plants, mammals and fish, especially <em>Tilapia</em>, probably depleted essential foods for the species<strong> </strong>(Pidgeon 1996), and natural habitat has been lost through the conversion of marsh areas to rice farms<strong> </strong>(Wilmé 1994).

In the late 19th Century, the species was persecuted as a pest, and it became unpopular with pig hunters for alerting animals to their presence (Faike 2006)<strong></strong>. The species was confiding and easily attracted by imitated calls, making it an easy target (Faike 2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. During breeding the species is sensitive to human disturbance <strong></strong>(Faike 2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, including nest-monitoring operations (Banko <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2002, Walters 2006)<strong></strong>. Other documented threats include predation by introduced rats, the small Asian mongoose <em>Herpestes javanicus </em>and<em> </em>the native Hawaiian Hawk <em>Buteo solitarius </em>(classified as Near Threatened), as well as avian malaria and pox carried by introduced mosquitoes (Maxfield 1998) <strong></strong>and <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> carried by feral cats (Banko <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2002, J. Burgett<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt.</span> 2007, Banko 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009)<strong></strong>. Feral cats are ubiquitous in the species's habitat and are also potential predators (J. Burgett<em> in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. Fledged chicks remain near the ground for several days before they can fly properly and are at particular risk from predation (Faike 2006, Banko <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2002). Captive-reared birds have suffered from disease, with at least one dying from a bacterial infection, and diseases may have made others more vulnerable to predation (Maxfield 1998, Banko <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, Banko 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). The captive population is inbred (Faike 2006, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, and this may be reducing reproductive success. West Nile Virus, which could potentially be introduced by migrating shorebirds and waterfowl or commercial transport, and is spread by mosquitoes (Faike 2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, could threaten reintroduction efforts in the future. West Nile Virus is presumed to be highly lethal in <em>C. hawaiiensis</em>, owing to a reduction in the population of the American Crow <em>C. brachyrhynchos</em> in mainland North America by 45% over eight years due to the virus (J. Burgett<em> in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","In 1992, there were only 11 or 12 birds in the wild (Maxfield 1998, Banko&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2002, Banko 2009)<strong></strong>, and the last two individuals were last seen in June 2002.&#160;The last known wild chick fledged in 1992, and the last viable wild egg was laid in 1996 (Faike 2006)<strong></strong>. The species persists in captive breeding facilities, with development of a reintroduction programme in progress (Lieberman and Kuehler 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). Captive breeding started in the 1970s, but few fledglings were produced until eggs from wild nests were harvested and hatched in captivity during 1993-1996 (Lieberman and Kuehler 2009, Banko 2009). A total of 27 captive-reared juveniles, originating from eggs laid either in the wild or in captivity, were released during 1993-1999 (Banko 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). By 1999, 21 released birds had died and the remaining six were captured to protect them and preserve genetic diversity (Maxfield 1998, Conrow 1999, Banko 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). In 2011, the captive population stood at 94 individuals (49 at the Keauhou Bird Conservation Center, 44 at the Maui Bird Conservation Center, and 1 at the San Diego Zoo), including 39 birds used as breeders (Switzer 2011).",,"<em>Corvus hawaiiensis</em> was distributed historically on Hawai`i in the Hawaiian Islands (<strong>USA</strong>), where the last individuals were found in and around the Kona Forest Unit of Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge. Bones of this or a closely related species have been found on Maui, indicating a wider distribution before Western contact (Banko <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2002, Banko 2009)<strong></strong>.&#160;Nesting by the last known wild birds was probably confined to higher elevations on Mauna Loa in South Kona (Faike 2006, Banko 2009)<strong></strong>. <br/><p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>Between 1993 and 2007, over 90 birds were hatched in the captive breeding programme (Lieberman and Kuehler 2009)<strong></strong>. Captive-raised individuals were released into lightly-managed habitat and monitored (Kuehler <em>et al.</em> 1994, Lieberman 1997, Banko 2009)<strong></strong>, but releases were stopped after January 1999 due to increasing mortality (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). About 75 birds need to be maintained in the captive flock for future reintroduction attempts to take place (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. In 2011, the captive population stood at 94 individuals, including 39 birds used as breeders  (Switzer 2011). Introduced mammalian predators were trapped in the Kona Forest Unit and, although this no longer takes place, predators will be managed at any future reintroduction sites (J. Burgett<em> in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Some areas of its former range are now fenced and free of feral ungulates, and the exclusion of ungulates will be extended into other areas (J. Burgett<em> in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Relocation of problematic <em>B. solitarius</em> failed because the birds homed back from over 32 km (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009)<strong></strong>. Two reintroduction sites have now been identified (Nelson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Following ungulate removal, fencing and habitat restoration, reintroduction at&#160;Puʻu Makaʻala Natural Area Reserve&#160;is due to begin with the release of 6 birds hatched in 2016. Ongoing restoration effort continues at the second site. A recovery plan was prepared in 1982 and revised in 2009<strong></strong>,  outlining recovery actions including expanding the captive propagation  to minimize loss of genetic diversity,  protecting suitable habitat and  managing threats to the species,  establishing new populations in  managed habitat, establishing a program  to increase public support, and  continuing research and adaptive  management practices for species  recovery (USFWS 2009).

Competition with introduced birds may have exacerbated the problems faced by this species<strong> </strong>(Wakelee and Fancy 1999), and introduced predators are likely to have also played a part (Woodworth <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2009). Deprived of lowland forest the species was also exposed to the effects of hurricane damage in upland forest, which severely disrupted portions of native forest and allowed the germination and expansion of noxious weeds (Pratt 1994, Conant <em>et al. </em>1998). Also potentially detrimental to the remaining suitable habitat are introductions of new alien invertebrates, such as the two-spotted leafhopper (<em>Sophonia rufofascia</em>), which may threaten many food plants of <em>M. myadestinus</em><strong> </strong>(USFWS 2003).     <p></p>",None remain.,,"<em>Myadestes myadestinus</em> was endemic to Kaua'i in the Hawaiian Islands (<strong>USA</strong>).

It is therefore considered Extinct.","Cogger <em>et al.</em> (1983) state that this species was found in forest clearings, usually in leaf litter but occasionally on low vegetation or tree buttresses. It was reported to be locally abundant wherever sunlight penetrates the canopy, especially along tracks or roads with available sunlight (Cogger <em>et al. </em>1983).","H. Cogger (pers. comm. 2010) reported that the rapid decline in population numbers was due to direct and indirect impacts on the island's forest ecology of supercolony development in the invasive Yellow Crazy Ant (<em>Anoplolepis gracilipes</em>). The rapidity of the decline in both this species and other endemic lizards suggests however that the threatening processes causing these declines are multiple and complex, and crazy ant infestations are concentrated in coastal and near-coastal areas of Christmas Island. In particular, declines appear to have taken place in most native lizard species following the introduction of the Indian Wolf Snake (<em>Lycodon capucinus</em>) in the early 1980s (Andrew <em>et al. </em>2016), and Wolf Snake predation is now understood to be the proximate cause of this skink's extinction.

118976576,54583,Anaxyrus baxteri,Extinct in the Wild,,2022,2020-06-02 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Extinct in the Wild because this species is believed to have become extinct following declines in the 1960s and 1970s. Although a wild population has since been reintroduced into its native range, a self-sustaining breeding population has not successfully been re-established, and the species is entirely reliant on intensive management and the release of captive-bred individuals for successful recruitment.","Historically, this species is associated with floodplain ponds along the Big and Little Laramie Rivers. It is known to inhabit a variety of wetland habitats, including lakes, ponds, streams, marshes, and roadside ditches (Green <em>et al</em>. 2014). The use of lakes might have been limited due to saline conditions, however it is possible that irrigation might have flushed out the lakes and made them more suitable for toads (G. Baxter pers. comm.). Individuals use rodent burrows for shelter, and are inactive during the cold season. Breeding takes place from mid-May to mid-June, and larvae metamorphose by early August. This species is a colonial breeder, although breeding aggregations tend to be small. Adults feed on a variety of&#160;small terrestrial arthropods, while larvae eat organic debris, algae, and plant tissue.","This species is particularly at risk due to its extremely limited distribution and small population size, and is is entirely dependent on captive releases for its survival in the wild. A lack of genetic diversity might also limit this species' abundance in the Laramie Basin. The primary threats within its range include the lack of suitable habitat available for future reintroductions within its historic range, and the infectious disease chytridiomycosis caused by the fungal pathogen <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis </em>(<em>Bd</em>). Mortenson Lake is known to be infected with the amphibian chytrid fungus (<em>Bd</em>) (USFWS 2002). This fungus has been implicated in declines and extinctions of amphibian species worldwide. Retrospective analysis shows that the fungus has been present at Mortenson Lake since at least 1989, and it continues to pose a major threat to this species. In 2003, a die-off of Wyoming toads at Mortenson Lake was attributed to <em>Bd</em>, and results from USFWS surveys conducted from 2008–2010 reported 67–100% <em>Bd</em> positive rates in tested toads (Polasik<em> et al.</em> 2015). In addition, chytridiomycosis has been recorded within the captive population. Additional threats to the species include predation (especially by mustelids), pesticide use, and ongoing irrigation practices. The cause of the original decline remains unknown but might be associated with the invasion of chytrid into the area (USFWS 2002). Mortenson Lake has also experienced ongoing habitat degradation, including becoming more saline (and less suitable for toads) as a result of drought-related increases in evaporation (USFWS 2002e). Additionally, the height and density of vegetation may be greater around Mortenson Lake than it historically was due to decreased intensity of cattle grazing and lack of fire. Previous observations of this species recorded individuals surviving in close association with cattle grazing, so this change in management practices could be causing habitat degradation (Polasik <em>et al.</em> 2015).","This species was common in the 1950s, but underwent a large decline in the 1960s and 1970s. This species was federally listed as endangered in 1984, and was presumed extinct by 1985 (Baxter and Stromberg 1980, Stromberg 1981, Vankirk 1980, Baxter<em> et al</em>. 1982, Baxter and Stone 1985, Lewis <em>et al</em>. 1985). A small extant population consisting of approximately 100–150 adults was discovered at Mortenson Lake in 1987 (Stone 1991), and the population continued to reproduce successfully with all life stages represented until 1989. On September 1, 1989 the last ten remaining individuals were removed from Mortenson Lake and taken into captivity (McCleary 1989, USFWS 2015). Captive breeding began in mid-1990s using the toads taken from Mortenson Lake and&#160;reintroduction efforts were started in 1995 (USFWS 2002,&#160;2015). Despite over 20 years of reintroduction efforts (over 187,000 individuals were released from 1995 to 2013), breeding populations of the Wyoming Toad have not re-established (Dodd 2013, Polasik&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).&#160;As of 2017, the population was known to have 1,500 individuals in existence across five sites, with this number experiencing dramatic fluctuations year-to-year (NPR 2017). There is little wild breeding taking place and no breeding activity has been documented in recent years at any of the currently known sites. Thus, none of these populations is currently self-sustaining (USFWS 2015). Despite releases of captive-reared individuals, the population at Mortenson Lake NWR appears to be declining (USFWS 2002).<strong><br/></strong>",,"This species is restricted to the Laramie Basin in Albany County, Wyoming, USA. Historically, this species was commonly found across 1,820 km<sup>2</sup> of the Laramie Basin.

This species was initially collected on Pitcairn by Miss Rosalind Young in 1898 from Palver Valley Ridge but only described as a new species in 1981 by Fosberg. It was seen in the wild in 1955 by I.T. Twyford and collected by H. St. John in 1934. However, it was not found during the flora and vegetation survey of 1997, despite searches of known locations (Kingston 2001). It was re-discovered in 2003 at Tesdide by local islander Carol Warren. Cuttings and seeds were collected and propagated from this rediscovery and replanted at this location. In January 2005, a landslide on the island destroyed the original Tedside plant and three planted seedlings at this location.

Secondly, trapping for the illegal live bird trade in recent decades pushed the species towards extinction. In addition, the colonisation of the distributional range by introduced aggressive African bees, and the building of the Sobradinho hydroelectric dam above Juazeiro may have contributed, perhaps significantly, to the species's decline in the 1970s and 1980s. Direct hunting is considered a factor of minor importance in the overall decline (Barros <em>et. al.</em>&#160;2012), even though several reports of shooting are on record.

Tortoises with up to 50%&#160;<em>abingdonii</em>&#160;genes have been reported from <a>Volcán Wolf </a>on northern Isabela, including first generation hybrids, but no pure individuals of&#160;<em>abingdonii</em>&#160;are known to exist (TEWG, 2015).&#160;This assessment incorporates contributions from&#160;the international workshop on&#160;Galápagos tortoises&#160;convened by the Galápagos National Park Directorate&#160;in July 2012.","<em>Chelonoidis abingdonii</em> was a saddlebacked tortoise adapted for browsing on higher vegetation,&#160;in particular, low-hanging cactus pads. Pinta habitat, before its destruction by feral goats, was largely dry xeric brushland and grassland at lower elevations, with limited more mesic forest habitat at higher elevations.&#160;<em>Opuntia</em>&#160;cactus trees are dominant in much of the Arid and Transition Zones on the island and provide an important food resource for tortoises.

The last surviving animal, Lonesome George, was collected from the wild in 1972 and transferred to the Government of Ecuador’s Tortoise Centre on Santa Cruz, where he died on 24 June 2012. No further animals have been found on Pinta despite extensive surveys (Pritchard 1996).&#160;During the final goat eradication project (1998-2003), park ranger activity covered the island and yielded no sign of tortoises.

This was a crepuscular and partially nocturnal lizard (Vaillant 1882), which preyed on bird eggs and fledglings (Hazevoet 1994). Animals would also scavenge dead birds (Hazevoet 1994). Females laid two eggs per clutch (Andreone and Guarino 2003). It is hypothesized that sexual maturity was reached at five (males) or six (females) years of age (Andreone and Guarino 2003), but age estimation in these lizards is uncertain and maturity may have been reached later. Sexual dimorphism was most pronounced after eight years.","Rats, cats and dogs have all been introduced to Santa Luzia, where they represented the major predators of this lizard (Andreone and Guarino 2003). As well as directly preying on the skink, rats and cats competed with them for food and may have caused declines in the seabird colonies on which this lizard relies. Particularly in times of drought, humans have also used the skink as a food source (Schleich 1982), for medicine and skins (Bocage 1873), and commercial trade for scientific purposes (Andreone and Guarino 2003). Low population numbers and recruitment, slow growth rates (Andreone and Guarino 2003), and a restricted range on a single island and two smaller islets all put this skink at extremely high risk from these threatening processes, as well as from stochastic events (particularly droughts, thought likely to have contributed to the species' extinction - Andreone<em> </em>2000), and it is now thought to be extinct.","This species was last seen alive in 1912, and has been considered extinct by some authors (e.g. Andreone and Guarino 2003) and in the First Red List of Cape Verde (Schleich 1996).

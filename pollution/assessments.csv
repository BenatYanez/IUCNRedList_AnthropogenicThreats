546437,14881,Notropis amecae,Extinct in the Wild,,2019,2018-12-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is endemic to the upper Río Ameca in Jalisco, Mexico. The species was considered extinct in 2000, but was later found in 2005 and 2008. In 2014, intensive surveys during ten months in the entire range of its distribution, and using different sampling techniques, did not find the species. In 2016, 40 individuals were reintroduced in its native range. Recent surveys have recorded the species there, but it is unclear if the population is viable. Based on this, the species is considered Extinct in the Wild. If the introduced population proves to be viable in the next few years, a reassessment should be conducted and a change in category may be considered.","<p>The species used to occur above 1,300 m Asl, in the channel of Río Ameca and two tributaries, one fed by warm springs with much vegetation (including water hyacinth, green algae, <em>Ceratophyllum</em>, and <em>Potamogeton</em>), in slight, moderate or swift current, over sand, rock, and silt, at depths up to about 1 m (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2005). The Teuchitlán River (tributary fed by springs) has an average width of 6 m, with a bottom of silt, sand, gravel, rocks and boulders (Chernoff and Miller 1986).<br/><br/>Spawning probably occurs from early spring to late summer, as suggested by mature adults and appearance of young.<strong>&#160;</strong>A single mature female examined contained 272 eggs (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2005, Soto-Galera and Alcántara-Soria 2007).&#160;</p><p></p>","The Teuchitlán River has been subject to destruction and modification resulting from the extraction of water for human consumption (Miller and Fitzsimons 1971, Williams&#160;<em>et al.</em> 1989). The river receives domestic drainage, effluents from runoff from agricultural fields of sugar and tequila agave that are subject to frequent applications of pesticides (López-López&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003). In addition, the Ameca River basin is classified as strongly contaminated (Vázquez-Gutiérrez 1994).&#160;The exact cause of the population decline is not known but may be related to habitat loss from ground water depletion (López-López and Paulo Maya 2001). There are six introduced species in the Teuchitlán River that may be affecting this species (O. Domínguez Domínguez pers. comm. 2018). Introduced species represent 90% of total biomass and abundance of the species collected in the river (O.

1998432,191696,Allotoca goslinei,Extinct in the Wild,,2019,2018-03-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Given the fact, that <em>Allotoca goslinei&#160;</em>was the dominant fish (ca. 75% proportional abundance) at the last known location of the study by Helmus <em>et al. </em>(2009), and then decreased in numbers since about the year 2000, to a few individuals in 2004, and zero when the habitat was extensively sampled in 2005–2006, it can be inferred that the species has disappeared completely from the wild. <br/><br/>With no known location and no known wild population, but several captive populations in Europe, Mexico and the United States, the Banded Allotoca is assessed Extinct in the Wild.","Here is the habitat description from Smith and Miller (1987), slightly modified by Köck in 2018: ""At the type locality, the Río Potrero Grande flows through a steep-walled, twisting canyon of high gradient that is well shaded by willows (<em>Salix</em> spp.) and the canyon walls. The species was taken only from a quiet pool of clear to murky water, that was about 23 m long and 3.2-3.8 m wide, up to 1.2 m deep at the steeply shelving south bank and with a substrate of sand, silt, rocks and boulders. Filamentous algae were abundant, and there were small patches of floating vascular plants. In the dry season the current was slight to nil. This was the terminal pool before the creek emerged from the canyon and dropped precipitously to the Río Ameca. <em>Allotoca goslinei </em>was found primarily in shallow water (15-26 cm) underneath floating plants (water hyacinth, algae, and a <em>Nasturtium</em>-like plant) along the gradually sloping north side of the pool. The largest series came from beneath a single patch of floating plants about 3 m long and extending no more than 1 m into the pool. The water temperature during three visits were 16.4-20 °C from mid-day to late afternoon, mid February to early March. Other fishes taken in the same pool were a Catostomid, <em>Moxostoma mascotae</em> (now: <em>Moxostoma austrinum</em>), a Goodeid, <em>Allodontichthys</em> n. sp. (now: <em>Allodontichthys polylepis</em>) and a Poeciliid, <em>Poeciliopsis infans</em>. <em>Rana</em> sp. was also captured, including tagpoles and adults."" Wischnath (1993) additionally mentioned <em>Ilyodon furcidens</em> being a co-inhabitant. Based on the diet of related species, the Banded Allotoca was most likely feeding on small arthropods in the wild (Domínguez-Domínguez <em>et al.</em>&#160;2002, Doadrio and Domínguez-Domínguez 2004, Webb <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). <br/><br/>Schindler reported to Hieronimus  (Hieronimus 1995), that on his visit of the type location in 1988, the water looked very polluted and reminded him more on a sewer than on a pool. The water was turbid, with little visibility, and the fish were caught only incidentally, but all species mentioned by Smith and Miller (1987) were present. Following Hieronimus, the condition of the habitat might be caused by an extremely dry spring in 1988.","<em>Allotoca goslinei </em>was moderately common until the year 2000 at the type location in the Río Potrero Grande. About that year, non native and invasive Green Swordtails (<em>Xiphophorus hellerii</em>) occurred<em>,</em>&#160;which invaded the type locality between 2000 and 2004 and increased in abundance while&#160;<em>Allotoca goslinei </em>decreased in <em></em>abundance.<em> </em>The Swordtail<em> </em>is thought to have displaced&#160;<em>Allotoca goslinei</em>&#160;through competition for prey (Arthington 1989), since the stream habitat quality did not noticeably change (Helmus&#160;<em>et al. </em>2009 unpublished data). Both species likely competed for the same sort of prey (Arthington 1989). <em><br/></em>","Deduced from inconclusive surveys conducted by Helmus<em> et al.</em> in 2005 and 2006 (Helmus <em>et al. </em>2009), this species is likely extinct in nature. This can be decided due to the fact that in 2000&#160;<em>Alloctoca goslinei</em>&#160;was still the dominant fish at the type locality (ca. 75% proportional abundance), but in extensive samplings of the river five, six years later, no more specimens were found.

From this distribution pattern, it can be inferred that it was more widespread in the headwaters of the Río Ameca drainage, but stayed either unnoticed or was very scarce.

It disappeared from the type location even before it was described due to habitat alteration by river fragmentation, water pollution, competition through non-native fish (<em>Xiphophorus maculatus</em>) and through destruction of the embankment by live stock, leading to a complete disappearance of habitat. From the El Molino pond, it was extirpated by a heavy drought in 2010.&#160;<br/><br/>Taking into consideration that no wild population has been known for at least eight years, the species is assessed&#160;Extinct in the Wild.&#160;<em><em><br/></em><br/></em>","<p>The former habitat was a quiet, thermal and clear to murky water with only a slight current. The substrate was deep mud with a few rocks, silt and sand. A few species of aquatic plants were present, comprising <em>Eichhornia</em>, <em>Pistia</em>,<em> Ceratophyllum</em> and <em>Potamogeton</em>. The Golden Skiffia prefered depths of less than 0.5 m. Miller and Fitzsimons measured water temperatures between 24 and 26 °C in February 1976 (Miller 2005).&#160;The gut is about two to three times the length of the fish. Kingston documented the content, mainly pennate diatoms, some filamentous algae, one small snail and a few pollen grains. The teeth are mainly bifid in both rows. This species definitively grazes on aufwuchs and algae on vertical structures. Another indication for this feeding behaviour are the upturned lips and the wedge-shaped head.<br/><br/>The Balneario El Rincón is a trapezium shaped spring with clear water and ground of sand and silt. The width is about 12 m, the length is about 25 m long. There is an outlet into a dammed section of the Teuchitlán river used as cattle trough, and another outlet draining to the subsequent section of the river. The depth of the spring is around 1 m, the walls are concrete but bordered inwards partly with big rocks. In the east angle arises the main spring under the roots of a large&#160;<em>Metasequoia</em>&#160;tree.&#160;</p>","The species has disappeared from the wild. The biggest threat to a wild population will be non-native fish species. Several exotic species have been introduced near the type locality resulting in declines in native fishes within the Río Teuchitlán (Miller 2005). Meanwhile, exotic species (<em>Oreochromis</em>&#160;sp.,&#160;<em>Xiphophorus hellerii</em>,&#160;<em>Poecilia mexicana</em>,&#160;<em>Pseudoxiphophorus bimaculatus</em>) make up to 95% of the individuals in the spring area of Teuchitlán (Medina-Nava&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). A study revealed that densities of Goodeid species were lower or were absent in localities in the Río Teuchitlán, where introduced species were abundant or where there were more than one introduced species (De La Vega-Salazar&#160;<em>et al</em><em>.</em>&#160;2003b). The river has been degraded due to the construction of the La Vega Dam and it is suggested that habitat degradation may have been the cause of the extant endemic Goodeids now being confined to a small area at the headwaters of the river. The species was also threatened as consequence of the springs being turned into spas, preventing movement of fish between pools (De La Vega-Salazar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003a).","This species is believed to be Extinct in the Wild and disappeared from the Río Teuchitlán due to competition from non-native fish, eventually&#160;<em>Xiphophorus maculatus</em>, through water pollution and river fragmentation, and modification of the springs into a water recreation area. The subpopulation from the El Molino pond, discovered in 2006, was a victim of a heavy drought in 2010 and became extirpated as well.&#160;<p></p>",,"The Golden Skiffia is a freshwater fish species endemic to the Mexican federal state of Jalisco.

However, this species disappeared from all of these habitats and only persists in captivity.","The species is not used for human consumption, but targeted in the aquarium trade by a certain degree.

10838671,43993,Vanvoorstia bennettiana,Extinct,,2003,2003-04-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The red alga <em>Vanvoorstia bennettiana</em> has only ever been collected from two sites (in the world).  The initial discovery, the type locality, was from the seabed at the eastern end of Spectacle Island in Parramatta River sometime between the 1st and the 16th May in 1855.  This site is now operated by the Royal Australian Navy as an explosives storage (barge), administrative offices and a mooring site for destroyers and other large Naval vessels.  The shoreline has been altered and strengthened and the seabed is regularly dredged to allow ample draught for large ships.  This site was first surveyed by myself and colleague Mr Peter Richards in December 1988.  Since then, seven dives during all seasons up until  23 April 2001, have been undertaken at that site.  No specimens have been discovered, and the only alga found there was a species of the genus <em>Sargassum</em>, that appears to tolerate low light, high nutrient, regularly disturbed conditions.
<br/>
<br/>The only other site known to have harbored this species was on the seabed between Point Piper and Shark Island in Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour).  This was collected by Dr Ramsay of the Australian Museum in October 1886.  This site was also surveyed by myself and colleague Mr Peter Richards firstly in December 1988 then numerous times (approx 10) since.  The seabed in this area now has no solid rocky substrata to which any seaweed could attach, the sediment is approximately 1 m thick (a divers arm disappears to the shoulder) and is easily stirred up by divers and passing ferry traffic.  The surrounding rocky foreshore of both Point Piper and Shark Island have only small amounts of the kelp <em>Ecklonia radiata</em> and the green alga <em>Caulerpa filiformis</em> growing on them. Both are known to tolerate heavily disturbed conditions.  No specimens of <em>Vanvoorstia bennettiana</em> have been discovered.
<br/>
<br/>Within Parramatta River and Port Jackson proper, I have logged some 50 dives from 12 different sites, all of which have reasonable coverage of a few marine algal species typical of the NSW coastline.  Based on knowledge of two other species in the genus <em>Vanvoorstia</em>, in addition to known growth strategies and environmental preferences of other genera and species of the red algal family Delesseriaceae, to which <em>Vanvoorstia bennettiana</em> belongs, such areas should harbor this species.  In 1913, the then Curator of Algae at the Royal Botanic Gardens Sydney, Arthur Lucas, published a paper in the Proceedings of the Linnaean Society of NSW in which he states ""I have never obtained it [<em>Vanvoorstia bennettiana</em>] either cast up or by dredging.""  He was an active collector of algae along the NSW coast up until his death in 1936.  The next Curator of Algae was Ms Valerie May who was also an active collector until her retirement in 1988, when I took over the position.  She was also unable to rediscover this species.
<br/>
<br/>Since 1980, I have logged in excess of 540 dives along the NSW coast as part of  a state government research priority to document the entire marine algal flora of the coast.  Our collections have come from Cape Howe in the very south of the state, to Cook Island on the Queensland/NSW border, with approximately 100 sites scattered in between.  The red algal species <em>Vanvoorstia bennettiana</em> has not been discovered during any of these dives.
<br/>
<br/>Several colleagues of mine from the universities of Southern Cross, New England, NSW, Sydney, and Wollongong, plus the Solitary Island Underwater Research Group (SURG), and the operators of every commercial dive shop I have worked through in NSW, have all been briefed on the identification of this and several other rare species of marine algae. None has reported a sighting during the 12 years I have been based at the Royal Botanic Gardens Sydney. The genus is known to have an isomorphic alternation of generations.  This means that the haploid male and female macrophytic gametophytes are morphologically identical to the diploid macrophytic tetrasporophytes which they ultimately produce.  There is no crustose or resting stage in the life cycle of the species, which may have allowed it to lie dormant for many years until environmental conditions were favourable.  In short, both life stages are susceptible to the same environmental parameters.
<br/>
<br/>The Extinct category is used 'when there is no reasonable doubt that the last individual has died.' With negative data there can always be some doubt. And new species continue to be found in Australian marine waters, even in Sydney Harbour (J.R. Paxton in litt.). The presence of 15 individuals in one collection indicates that  the species was relatively common in at least one portion of Sydney Harbour at that time. Given the isomorphic alternation of generations, it seems most unlikely that the species would remain in existence and remain undetected for more than 100 years. Therefore as no specimens have been seen or collected in the intervening 116 years, despite numerous collections made by algologists in that period, the species can be considered truly Extinct.","Unknown at time of collection in 1855 and 1886.  The two sites, and much of Sydney Harbour, presently has soft sediment seabed with scattered rocky reef and rocky intertidal shores.  Scattered shells and solid waste products (cans, bottles etc.) also lie on the seabed.","Sydney Harbour is in the middle of the city of Sydney, the largest metropolis in Australia with more than 4 million people. In the 200+ years since settlement, the harbour has been seriously degraded by the population explosion. Use of the harbour as recreational facility, port, source of food, and sewer has seriously impacted on the native flora and fauna. Even by 1880, the harbour was found to be overfished by a Royal Commission. The Major Threats that may have caused the extinction of this alga include large and small scale fisheries particularly trawling, infrastructure development including industry, human settlement, tourism/recreation, water transport [including dredging for ship passage], fisheries- related bycatch by netting, and water pollution from agriculture, domestic, commercial/ industrial, oil, sedimentation, and sewage. The water quality of the harbour has improved since the 1972 passage of the New South Wales Clean Waters Act and the more recent removal of sewage outfalls some kilometers offshore. More fish species have moved to the upper estuarine portions of the Parramatta River and whales have returned to the outer harbour. However, for sessile species of limited distribution like Bennetts seaweed, swimming out of the harbour was not an option and the damage was done, permanently. As we do not even know in which decade the extinction occurred, we will never know which of the major threats was causative; a combination of a number of those listed is likely.

An artificial gravity-fed sprinkler system is currently in place to mimic the original conditions of the spray zone. The toad breeds by internal fertilization, with females retaining the larvae internally in the oviduct until little toadlets are born. Clutch size varies from 5–13 offspring (Channing <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2006).","The serious decline and extinction of this species appears tp be related to the Lower Kihansi Hydropower Project, which involved the construction of a dam upstream on the Kihansi River in 2000. The dam cut off 90% of the original water flow to the gorge, thereby hugely reducing the volume of spray, particularly in the dry season, as well as altering the vegetational composition. <br/><br/>An artificial gravity-fed sprinkler system was set up to mimic the natural spray of the Kihansi ecosystem with the remaining water flow. Unfortunately, the sprinkler system was not ready by the time the water was cut off in 2000, and by the time the sprinklers came on nine months later the ecosystem had already dried up (see Krajick 2006). Later, during the dry season in 2003, the artificial sprinkler system failed for a while. Around this time, the fungal disease chytridiomycosis was confirmed in dead animals of this species, and this disease is probably responsible for the final population crash. It is possible that the drought caused by the failure of the sprinkler system resulted in stress to the animals that rendered them susceptible to the disease. There are also reports that the 2003 crash coincided with a brief opening of the dam's floodgates to flush sediments; tests showed that these contained pesticides used in maize farming operations upstream, in concentrations sufficient to kill the toads (Krajick 2006). The impact of predation by safari ants (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Dorylus</span> sp.) and crabs (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Potomonautes</span> sp.) is unknown (Channing <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2006).","Formerly it was abundant in a tiny area, with a population of around 17,000 individuals.

It was last seen in 1990, and exhaustive surveys at the species' known sites and the only other adjacent site with suitable habitat at suitable elevations have failed to record the species in several decades. The species experienced drastic population declines, probably due to chytridiomycosis and habitat loss, and has apparently not recuperated.","This species lived on the ground along mountain streams in premontane and lower montane moist forest. It presumably bred by direct development, with eggs laid on land, similar to other species in the <em>Craugastor rugulosus</em>&#160;series&#160;(McCranie and Castaneda 2007).

Chytridiomycosis is thought to have contributed to the extinction of this species (J. Townsend, L. Herrera and J. Kolby pers. comm. March 2019), as well as habitat loss and degradation caused by&#160;agricultural encroachment, wood extraction, forest fires, water pollution, and landslides.&#160;The type locality of this species was already within a disturbed area of human settlement (J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019). The second locality, Rio Arcaqual, is affected at lower elevations by a small dam that is undergoing increased use pressure by local communities; and if the species was still present, then it is thought that this would be a threat to it (L. Herrera, J. Townsend and H. Vega pers. comm. March 2019).<br/><br/>Highland amphibians are adapted to inhabit a narrow climatic envelope. Changes in climate are expected to reduce the available suitable habitat and required microclimates. Rapid shifts in the climatic conditions required by these species would not allow sufficient opportunity for adaptation, especially in light of the limited possibility for elevational migration. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Wicaksono<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017, Lyra&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017, Neate-Clegg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). An increase in high rainfall events is being observed throughout its range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) in the Caribbean, destroying the riparian habitat required by stream-dwelling and stream-associated amphibian species (Honduras Amphibian Red List Workshop March 2019). Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g.<em>&#160;</em>chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2006, Blaustein&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).","It had always been extremely rare, and is now considered to be extinct.

In the late 20th century, the population declined drastically due to overfishing and habitat degradation. The population now appears to be Extinct in the Wild, as there is no evidence for natural reproduction any more, and no mature fish have been caught within the last 10 years.","Yangtze Sturgeon permanently lives in freshwater. It usually inhabits the upper and middle reaches of the river (it may also have entered the upper estuary of the Yangtze River). This species spawns in upper reaches of the Yangtze River, in the spring (March–April) and autumn (October–December). Its key spawning reach was between Maoshui and Hejiang, a stretch of 321.7 km (Yangtze Aquatic Resources Survey Group 1988).","Historically, this species experienced unsustainable levels of fishing. Furthermore, mesh sizes of fishing nets have been reduced, thereby capturing young sturgeon, especially during the periods when many juveniles concentrate to feed. Fishing effort and intensity has also increased in the past; for example, in the Neijiang reach of the Tuo River there were only 500 fishing boats in the1950s, but this increased to approximately 2,000 by 1985. In the Leshan Reach of the Ming River, drift gill nets are crowded together from day to night.<br/> <br/> The primary traditional fishing season in the main stream of the Yangzte River was between March and August, with more than 30% of the catch processed between April and May. This is also the spawning season for <em>Acipenser dabryanus</em>, therefore spawning stocks were particularly vulnerable to capture.<br/> <br/>The construction of the Gezhouba Dam in 1981 and the Three Gorges Dam in 2003 have also caused major adverse effects to the habitat of this species and, prior to the wild population disappearing, these constructions caused the population to be restricted to the upstream river, above the dams. The construction of the Xiangjiaba Dam in 2008 is situated in the middle of this sturgeon's spawning reach and is therefore expected to adversely affect it through habitat fragmentation and associated habitat degradation. More recently, two more dams were constructed upriver, changing the temperature and hydrology of the river.<br/> <br/> Additionally, pollution from human development affects the entire Yangtze basin. Much untreated waste water discharges into the river each year. Water quality is also affected by run-off caused by deforestation of the upper Yangtze Valley (Zhuang <em>et al</em>. 1997). Pollution has been declining regionally in recent years.","There seems to be no natural reproduction of this species any more, and there are no mature individuals of wild origin due to heavy overfishing. Historically, this was an important species in commercial fisheries of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River (Chen 2007). In the late 20th century, population numbers declined drastically due to overfishing and habitat degradation. Catch data between 1982 and 2019 indicate that since 2008, hundreds of individuals are being captured annually, all originating from releases (Wei 2019, pers. comm.). The species is now fully ranched, and no natural reproduction or natural population is documented in the wild. Artificial propagation began in 1976 by the Chongqing Fisheries Institute, China (Wei 2019, pers. comm.). From 2007 to 2018, approximately 200,000 juveniles were released into the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River for stock rehabilitation, which has not yet been proven successful. Since 2018, mature individuals have also been stocked. This, and the imminent total ban of fishing, will hopefully improve the chances of this species recovering in the future.",,"This species is endemic to China, where it is restricted to the Yangtze River system.

This species experienced a very rapid decline in the wild, from being common to extinct in just a few years, most likely due to chytridiomycosis. Extensive searches in the following 25 years failed to locate this species. There are fewer targeted searches for this species now that considerable time has passed since an individual was last seen in the wild.","This species lived in rainforest, wet sclerophyll forest and riverine gallery open forest at 350 m asl and was closely associated with watercourses and adjacent rock pools and soaks (Czechura 1991, Meyer <em>et al.</em> 2001). These streams are mostly perennial, but in extremely dry years they may cease to flow (Ingram 1983). The vegetation along the stream banks is usually closed forest or tall closed forest with emergent eucalypts, although there are some sites in open forest with grassy ground cover (Ingram 1983). In spring and summer individuals were usually found in or at the edge of rock pools, either amongst leaf-litter, under and between stones or in crevices around the edge (Ingram 1983). The species was also found under rock in shallow water in backwaters and also the main flow of permanent watercourses (Ingram 1983, Czechura 1991). <br/><br/>Searches of popular sites in winter only recovered two frogs and it is assumed that the species hibernated in deep crevices in rocks or spaces between rocks underwater during the colder months (Ingram 1983). Adult males tended to prefer deeper pools, whereas females and juveniles may have moved to newly created pools after rain as long as these pools contained stones and/or leaf-litter (Ingram 1983). The prerequisite for the use of pools by this species seemed to be that the pool must be deep enough for the frog to be able to sit with its head out of the water and be able to safely submerge (Ingram 1983). Individuals would only sit fully exposed on the rocks during light rain (Ingram 1983). The species&#160;was never recorded from cleared riparian habitat.<br/><br/>Breeding activity occurred between October and December (Ingram 1983). Males called from rock crevices above pools (Ingram 1983). Females brood young within their stomach and gave birth through the mouth (Tyler and Carter 1982). Fertilized eggs or early stage larvae were presumably swallowed by the female and completed their development in the stomach (Tyler and Carter 1982). The number of eggs in gravid females (approximately 40) exceeded the number of juveniles found to occur in the stomach (21–26) (Tyler 1989). It is not known whether or not the excess eggs were digested by the female or whether or not they were simply not swallowed (Tyler 1989). The production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach of the female ceased during brooding (Tyler <em>et al.</em> 1983). Tadpoles developed in a manner similar to the aquatic tadpoles of other species though, as they fed off egg yolk, the labial teeth were absent and the intestines formed at a later stage of development (Tyler 1989). After 6–7 weeks the females gave birth to up to 25 young (Tyler and Davies 1983a). Young emerged from the female’s mouth as fully formed frogs and after four days the digestive tract returned to normal and the female recommenced feeding (Tyler and Davies 1983b). Ingram (1983) reported minimum brooding periods from two individuals of 36 and 43 days and suggested that the duration was such that females were unlikely to breed twice in one season.","The reason(s) for the disappearance of this species remains unknown (Tyler and Davies 1985). Populations were present in logged catchments between 1972 and 1979. Although the species persisted in the streams during these activities, the effects of timber harvesting on this aquatic species were never investigated. Its habitat is currently threatened by feral pigs, invasion of weeds (especially Mistflower <em>Ageratina riparia</em>), and altered flow and water quality due to upstream disturbances (Hines <em>et al. </em>1999). However, from what is known from similar declines and disappearances elsewhere in the world, the disease chytridiomycosis must be suspected.","When first discovered, this species was extremely abundant and common. The species declined rapidly and disappeared at about the same time as a sympatric species <em>Taudactylus diurnus</em> (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Czechura and Ingram (1990) and Ingram (1990) state that the last frog was seen in the wild in 1979 on the Conondale Range. However, Richards <em>et al.</em> (1993) reported the existence of a specimen taken from the Blackall Range in September 1981. Despite intensive searching, the species has not been located since (Ingram and McDonald 1993, Hines <em>et al.</em> 1999). In the laboratory, the last known individual died in November 1983 (Tyler and Davies 1985b). Ingram (1983) studied a population of the species in the headwaters of Booloumba Creek, Conondale Range, and estimated that approximately 78 were present in 1976. No other estimates of population size are available for the species. This species is believed to be extinct.",,"This Australian endemic species was restricted to elevations between 350 and 800 m asl in the Blackall and Conondale Ranges in southeast Queensland (Hines <em>et al</em>. 1999) with a geographic distribution of less than 1,400 km<sup>2</sup> (map in Hines<em> et al</em>. 1999).

This species experienced a very rapid decline, from being relatively common to extinct in only three or four years, most likely due to chytridiomycosis.","The species&#160;was associated with permanent and temporary watercourses in montane rainforests, tall open forest, notophyll vine forest and sclerophyll fern forest (Czechura and Ingram 1990). In addition, animals were also found along watercourses in pure stands of the palm <em>Archontophoenix cunninghamia</em>, in exposed areas, in gorges, in dense non-forest riparian vegetation (<em>Lomandra longifolia</em>, <em>Carex neurochlamys</em>, <em>Elatostema reticulatum</em> and <em>Blechnum nudum</em>) and where the riparian vegetation had been slightly infested with <em>Lantana camara</em> (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Permanent streams with rocky substrates were favoured, but this species also occurred in permanent and ephemeral streams on gravel, clay, sand and soil substrates (Czechura and Ingram 1990). <br/><br/>Active frogs had been observed all year round, although less frequently during winter months (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Breeding occurred in warm weather after or during heavy rain from late October to May, with a January to March peak (Czechura and Ingram 1990, Meyer <em>et al.</em> 2001). Gravid females had been reported between November and May (Straughan and Lee 1966). Amplexus was inguinal and 24–36 eggs (2.2 mm diameter) were deposited in gelatinous clumps under rocks or branches in the water (Liem and Hosmer 1973, Watson and Martin 1973, Czechura and Ingram 1990, Meyer <em>et al. </em>2001). Tadpoles, illustrated by Liem and Hosmer (1973) and Watson and Martin (1973), were found throughout the year.","The reason(s) for the disappearance of this species remains unknown. Like <em>Rheobatrachus silus</em>, logging has occurred in catchments occupied by the species (Hines <em>et al. </em>1999); however, the effect of timber harvesting on the species has not been investigated. The species’ habitat is currently threatened by feral pigs, invasion of weed species (especially Mist Flower) and altered stream flow and water quality due to upstream disturbances (Hines <em>et al.</em> 1999). The species&#160;was not found in areas along watercourses that were heavily infested with <em>Lantana camara</em> or where the weeds <em>Baccharis halimifolia</em> and <em>Ageratina riparia</em> (Mist Flower) occurred (Czechura and Ingram 1990). The frogs were also absent from streams with very muddy water associated with the activities of feral pigs (Czechura and Ingram 1990). From what is known from similar declines and disappearance elsewhere in the world, the disease chytridiomycosis also must be suspected as a cause for the decline.","In the early 1970s this species was considered to be relatively common (McEvoy <em>et al.</em> 1979), but following a very rapid decline it has not been sighted in the wild since 1979 despite continued efforts to relocate the species (Hines <em>et al.</em> 1999). The disappearance of the species occurred over a period of three to four years, disappearing from the D’Aguilar Range in late 1975, then from the Blackall Range in late 1978, and finally from the Conondale Range in early 1979 (Czechura and Ingram 1990).

Although a wild population has since been reintroduced into its native range, a self-sustaining breeding population has not successfully been re-established, and the species is entirely reliant on intensive management and the release of captive-bred individuals for successful recruitment.","Historically, this species is associated with floodplain ponds along the Big and Little Laramie Rivers. It is known to inhabit a variety of wetland habitats, including lakes, ponds, streams, marshes, and roadside ditches (Green <em>et al</em>. 2014). The use of lakes might have been limited due to saline conditions, however it is possible that irrigation might have flushed out the lakes and made them more suitable for toads (G. Baxter pers. comm.). Individuals use rodent burrows for shelter, and are inactive during the cold season. Breeding takes place from mid-May to mid-June, and larvae metamorphose by early August. This species is a colonial breeder, although breeding aggregations tend to be small. Adults feed on a variety of&#160;small terrestrial arthropods, while larvae eat organic debris, algae, and plant tissue.","This species is particularly at risk due to its extremely limited distribution and small population size, and is is entirely dependent on captive releases for its survival in the wild. A lack of genetic diversity might also limit this species' abundance in the Laramie Basin. The primary threats within its range include the lack of suitable habitat available for future reintroductions within its historic range, and the infectious disease chytridiomycosis caused by the fungal pathogen <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis </em>(<em>Bd</em>). Mortenson Lake is known to be infected with the amphibian chytrid fungus (<em>Bd</em>) (USFWS 2002). This fungus has been implicated in declines and extinctions of amphibian species worldwide. Retrospective analysis shows that the fungus has been present at Mortenson Lake since at least 1989, and it continues to pose a major threat to this species. In 2003, a die-off of Wyoming toads at Mortenson Lake was attributed to <em>Bd</em>, and results from USFWS surveys conducted from 2008–2010 reported 67–100% <em>Bd</em> positive rates in tested toads (Polasik<em> et al.</em> 2015). In addition, chytridiomycosis has been recorded within the captive population. Additional threats to the species include predation (especially by mustelids), pesticide use, and ongoing irrigation practices. The cause of the original decline remains unknown but might be associated with the invasion of chytrid into the area (USFWS 2002). Mortenson Lake has also experienced ongoing habitat degradation, including becoming more saline (and less suitable for toads) as a result of drought-related increases in evaporation (USFWS 2002e). Additionally, the height and density of vegetation may be greater around Mortenson Lake than it historically was due to decreased intensity of cattle grazing and lack of fire. Previous observations of this species recorded individuals surviving in close association with cattle grazing, so this change in management practices could be causing habitat degradation (Polasik <em>et al.</em> 2015).","This species was common in the 1950s, but underwent a large decline in the 1960s and 1970s. This species was federally listed as endangered in 1984, and was presumed extinct by 1985 (Baxter and Stromberg 1980, Stromberg 1981, Vankirk 1980, Baxter<em> et al</em>. 1982, Baxter and Stone 1985, Lewis <em>et al</em>. 1985). A small extant population consisting of approximately 100–150 adults was discovered at Mortenson Lake in 1987 (Stone 1991), and the population continued to reproduce successfully with all life stages represented until 1989. On September 1, 1989 the last ten remaining individuals were removed from Mortenson Lake and taken into captivity (McCleary 1989, USFWS 2015). Captive breeding began in mid-1990s using the toads taken from Mortenson Lake and&#160;reintroduction efforts were started in 1995 (USFWS 2002,&#160;2015). Despite over 20 years of reintroduction efforts (over 187,000 individuals were released from 1995 to 2013), breeding populations of the Wyoming Toad have not re-established (Dodd 2013, Polasik&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).&#160;As of 2017, the population was known to have 1,500 individuals in existence across five sites, with this number experiencing dramatic fluctuations year-to-year (NPR 2017). There is little wild breeding taking place and no breeding activity has been documented in recent years at any of the currently known sites. Thus, none of these populations is currently self-sustaining (USFWS 2015). Despite releases of captive-reared individuals, the population at Mortenson Lake NWR appears to be declining (USFWS 2002).<strong><br/></strong>",,"This species is restricted to the Laramie Basin in Albany County, Wyoming, USA.

Together with its only outlet (Agus River), Lake Lanao is the major source of hydroelectric power, providing the majority of the electricity needs of Mindanao (Escudero 1995, Rosagaron 2001, Naga 2010, UPLB-DENR 2014). It has a surface area of 357 km<sup>2</sup>, a maximum depth of 112 m, a mean depth of 60.3 m, a replacement time of 6.5 years, and a lake surface altitude of 702 m (Frey 1969).",This species was exploited commercially as food fish in 1963-1964 (Sanguila <em>et al.</em> 1975).

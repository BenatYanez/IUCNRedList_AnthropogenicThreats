1998432,191696,Allotoca goslinei,Extinct in the Wild,,2019,2018-03-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Given the fact, that <em>Allotoca goslinei&#160;</em>was the dominant fish (ca. 75% proportional abundance) at the last known location of the study by Helmus <em>et al. </em>(2009), and then decreased in numbers since about the year 2000, to a few individuals in 2004, and zero when the habitat was extensively sampled in 2005–2006, it can be inferred that the species has disappeared completely from the wild. <br/><br/>With no known location and no known wild population, but several captive populations in Europe, Mexico and the United States, the Banded Allotoca is assessed Extinct in the Wild.","Here is the habitat description from Smith and Miller (1987), slightly modified by Köck in 2018: ""At the type locality, the Río Potrero Grande flows through a steep-walled, twisting canyon of high gradient that is well shaded by willows (<em>Salix</em> spp.) and the canyon walls. The species was taken only from a quiet pool of clear to murky water, that was about 23 m long and 3.2-3.8 m wide, up to 1.2 m deep at the steeply shelving south bank and with a substrate of sand, silt, rocks and boulders. Filamentous algae were abundant, and there were small patches of floating vascular plants. In the dry season the current was slight to nil. This was the terminal pool before the creek emerged from the canyon and dropped precipitously to the Río Ameca. <em>Allotoca goslinei </em>was found primarily in shallow water (15-26 cm) underneath floating plants (water hyacinth, algae, and a <em>Nasturtium</em>-like plant) along the gradually sloping north side of the pool. The largest series came from beneath a single patch of floating plants about 3 m long and extending no more than 1 m into the pool. The water temperature during three visits were 16.4-20 °C from mid-day to late afternoon, mid February to early March. Other fishes taken in the same pool were a Catostomid, <em>Moxostoma mascotae</em> (now: <em>Moxostoma austrinum</em>), a Goodeid, <em>Allodontichthys</em> n. sp. (now: <em>Allodontichthys polylepis</em>) and a Poeciliid, <em>Poeciliopsis infans</em>. <em>Rana</em> sp. was also captured, including tagpoles and adults."" Wischnath (1993) additionally mentioned <em>Ilyodon furcidens</em> being a co-inhabitant. Based on the diet of related species, the Banded Allotoca was most likely feeding on small arthropods in the wild (Domínguez-Domínguez <em>et al.</em>&#160;2002, Doadrio and Domínguez-Domínguez 2004, Webb <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). <br/><br/>Schindler reported to Hieronimus  (Hieronimus 1995), that on his visit of the type location in 1988, the water looked very polluted and reminded him more on a sewer than on a pool. The water was turbid, with little visibility, and the fish were caught only incidentally, but all species mentioned by Smith and Miller (1987) were present. Following Hieronimus, the condition of the habitat might be caused by an extremely dry spring in 1988.","<em>Allotoca goslinei </em>was moderately common until the year 2000 at the type location in the Río Potrero Grande. About that year, non native and invasive Green Swordtails (<em>Xiphophorus hellerii</em>) occurred<em>,</em>&#160;which invaded the type locality between 2000 and 2004 and increased in abundance while&#160;<em>Allotoca goslinei </em>decreased in <em></em>abundance.<em> </em>The Swordtail<em> </em>is thought to have displaced&#160;<em>Allotoca goslinei</em>&#160;through competition for prey (Arthington 1989), since the stream habitat quality did not noticeably change (Helmus&#160;<em>et al. </em>2009 unpublished data). Both species likely competed for the same sort of prey (Arthington 1989). <em><br/></em>","Deduced from inconclusive surveys conducted by Helmus<em> et al.</em> in 2005 and 2006 (Helmus <em>et al. </em>2009), this species is likely extinct in nature. This can be decided due to the fact that in 2000&#160;<em>Alloctoca goslinei</em>&#160;was still the dominant fish at the type locality (ca. 75% proportional abundance), but in extensive samplings of the river five, six years later, no more specimens were found. Based on this, the Banded Allotoca is feared to be Extinct in the Wild (Lyons 2011). A few captive strains do exist in Europe, Mexico and the United States, but all of them are low in numbers and not easy to maintain.",,"The Banded Allotoca was endemic to the Mexican federal state of Jalisco and historically only known from few collections in the headwaters of the Río Ameca, namely from the type location, the Río Grande&#160;(or Río, Arroyo, Potrero Grande about 10 km west of the town of Ameca), and from the Río Cuisillos (1 km east of the train station at Pacana near the Presa La Vega, where it coalesces with the Río Salado forming up the Río Ameca) (Smith and Miller 1987). From this distribution pattern, it can be inferred that it was more widespread in the headwaters of the Río Ameca drainage, but stayed either unnoticed or was very scarce. However, it was eliminated from the Río Ameca by the late 1990's, but remained moderately common in the Río Potrero Grande (Lyons 2011), until non-native swordtails (<em style="""">Xiphophorus hellerii</em>) invaded the river after 2000. Being the dominant species in 2000, with about 75% proportional abundance, the numbers of <em style="""">Allotoca goslinei</em> declined rapidly thereafter, and extensive samplings in 2005 and 2006 didn't show a single individual (Helmus&#160;<em style="""">et al. </em>2009).

Population declines were first noted in the 1970s when lake levels were lowered. In 1988 a massive outflow event resulted in a catastrophic drop in lake level of 60 cm, isolating the zone were the species is normally found. This combined with interference of inflow streams, and hot, dry summers have led to extensive damage to the entire lake's littoral zone.

Although presently dominated by the unpalatable shrub renosterbos (<em>Elytropappus rhinocerotis</em>), this habitat would have possessed a high grass cover (<em>Themeda triandra, Merxmuellera stricta</em>) (Cowling and Heijnis 2001).","Although habitat loss and hunting played proximate roles in the  extinction of the species, hunting merely tipped the species over the  extinction edge it was already straddling, as long-term climate change  is suspected to have played a more important role by fragmenting and  reducing the resilience of the population (Kerley <em>et al</em>. 2009, Tyler Faith and Thompson 2013).",The last individual Blue Antelope was shot around 1800; it was the first   African antelope to be hunted to extinction by European settlers (Klein   1974).,,"Historically the Blue Antelope was endemic to South Africa, where it was confined to a limited area of the southwestern Cape coast and where it was apparently uncommon. The species was first recorded in 1719 by Kolbe, and was described by Pallas in 1766 (Klein 1974) from material of uncertain provenance (Rookmaaker 1989). Its historical distribution is thus based on few records, of which only two can be considered to be reasonably precise (Kerley <em>et al</em>. 2009): Thunberg on 20 January 1774 and Le Vaillant in March/April 1783. An additional record in 1783 provided by Sparrman (1786) much further east at Krakeel River in the Langkloof may reflect a transported skin, given that this location is hundreds of kilometres east of other records. However, although the recent historical range is thought to be bounded by the locations of the Caledon, Swellendam and Bredasdorp, in the Western Cape (Skead 1980, Rookmaaker 1989), archaeological evidence suggests a previously much wider distribution: early in the Last Glacial (70,000–35,000 years before present (ybp)) it occurred on the grasslands of the Cape lowlands, south of the Cape Folded Belt from present day Grahamstown (farm ‘‘Uniondale’’) in the east to the vicinity of Saldanha Bay in the West.

Changes in climate are expected to reduce the available suitable habitat and required microclimates. Rapid shifts in the climatic conditions required by these species would not allow sufficient opportunity for adaptation, especially in light of the limited possibility for elevational migration. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Wicaksono<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017, Lyra&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017, Neate-Clegg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). An increase in high rainfall events is being observed throughout its range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) in the Caribbean, destroying the riparian habitat required by stream-dwelling and stream-associated amphibian species (Honduras Amphibian Red List Workshop March 2019). Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g.<em>&#160;</em>chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2006, Blaustein&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).","It had always been extremely rare, and is now considered to be extinct. Surveys were conducted for this species in 1995 and 1997, and no individuals were found (McCranie and Castaneda 2007). A two-night survey was conducted in 2008 at the type locality and did not record this species, and a 12 day survey (involving nine people for three days, and five people for the remaining six days) was conducted in 2015 that specifically looked for the two endemic amphibians on this mountain within suitable elevation range (including areas not previously surveyed for amphibians), and did not find the species (J.

118976576,54583,Anaxyrus baxteri,Extinct in the Wild,,2022,2020-06-02 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Extinct in the Wild because this species is believed to have become extinct following declines in the 1960s and 1970s. Although a wild population has since been reintroduced into its native range, a self-sustaining breeding population has not successfully been re-established, and the species is entirely reliant on intensive management and the release of captive-bred individuals for successful recruitment.","Historically, this species is associated with floodplain ponds along the Big and Little Laramie Rivers. It is known to inhabit a variety of wetland habitats, including lakes, ponds, streams, marshes, and roadside ditches (Green <em>et al</em>. 2014). The use of lakes might have been limited due to saline conditions, however it is possible that irrigation might have flushed out the lakes and made them more suitable for toads (G. Baxter pers. comm.). Individuals use rodent burrows for shelter, and are inactive during the cold season. Breeding takes place from mid-May to mid-June, and larvae metamorphose by early August. This species is a colonial breeder, although breeding aggregations tend to be small. Adults feed on a variety of&#160;small terrestrial arthropods, while larvae eat organic debris, algae, and plant tissue.","This species is particularly at risk due to its extremely limited distribution and small population size, and is is entirely dependent on captive releases for its survival in the wild. A lack of genetic diversity might also limit this species' abundance in the Laramie Basin. The primary threats within its range include the lack of suitable habitat available for future reintroductions within its historic range, and the infectious disease chytridiomycosis caused by the fungal pathogen <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis </em>(<em>Bd</em>). Mortenson Lake is known to be infected with the amphibian chytrid fungus (<em>Bd</em>) (USFWS 2002). This fungus has been implicated in declines and extinctions of amphibian species worldwide. Retrospective analysis shows that the fungus has been present at Mortenson Lake since at least 1989, and it continues to pose a major threat to this species. In 2003, a die-off of Wyoming toads at Mortenson Lake was attributed to <em>Bd</em>, and results from USFWS surveys conducted from 2008–2010 reported 67–100% <em>Bd</em> positive rates in tested toads (Polasik<em> et al.</em> 2015). In addition, chytridiomycosis has been recorded within the captive population. Additional threats to the species include predation (especially by mustelids), pesticide use, and ongoing irrigation practices. The cause of the original decline remains unknown but might be associated with the invasion of chytrid into the area (USFWS 2002). Mortenson Lake has also experienced ongoing habitat degradation, including becoming more saline (and less suitable for toads) as a result of drought-related increases in evaporation (USFWS 2002e). Additionally, the height and density of vegetation may be greater around Mortenson Lake than it historically was due to decreased intensity of cattle grazing and lack of fire. Previous observations of this species recorded individuals surviving in close association with cattle grazing, so this change in management practices could be causing habitat degradation (Polasik <em>et al.</em> 2015).","This species was common in the 1950s, but underwent a large decline in the 1960s and 1970s. This species was federally listed as endangered in 1984, and was presumed extinct by 1985 (Baxter and Stromberg 1980, Stromberg 1981, Vankirk 1980, Baxter<em> et al</em>. 1982, Baxter and Stone 1985, Lewis <em>et al</em>. 1985). A small extant population consisting of approximately 100–150 adults was discovered at Mortenson Lake in 1987 (Stone 1991), and the population continued to reproduce successfully with all life stages represented until 1989. On September 1, 1989 the last ten remaining individuals were removed from Mortenson Lake and taken into captivity (McCleary 1989, USFWS 2015). Captive breeding began in mid-1990s using the toads taken from Mortenson Lake and&#160;reintroduction efforts were started in 1995 (USFWS 2002,&#160;2015). Despite over 20 years of reintroduction efforts (over 187,000 individuals were released from 1995 to 2013), breeding populations of the Wyoming Toad have not re-established (Dodd 2013, Polasik&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).&#160;As of 2017, the population was known to have 1,500 individuals in existence across five sites, with this number experiencing dramatic fluctuations year-to-year (NPR 2017). There is little wild breeding taking place and no breeding activity has been documented in recent years at any of the currently known sites. Thus, none of these populations is currently self-sustaining (USFWS 2015). Despite releases of captive-reared individuals, the population at Mortenson Lake NWR appears to be declining (USFWS 2002).<strong><br/></strong>",,"This species is restricted to the Laramie Basin in Albany County, Wyoming, USA. Historically, this species was commonly found across 1,820 km<sup>2</sup> of the Laramie Basin. It was presumed extinct by 1985 (Baxter&#160;and Stromberg 1980, Stromberg 1981, Vankirk 1980, Baxter <em>et al. </em>1982<strong>, </strong>Baxter and&#160;Stone 1985, Lewis <em>et al. </em>1985).&#160;In 1987, a small remnant population was discovered at Mortenson Lake (Stone 1991).<strong>&#160;</strong>In 1989, all remaining wild individuals from&#160;Mortenson Lake were taken into captivity, and reintroduction efforts were started in 1995 (McCleary 1989, USFWS 2015). All wild-occurring toads are considered to be the product of reintroduction efforts (USFWS 2015). This species' distribution is now restricted to Mortenson Lake National Wildlife Refuge and two private land sites protected under the Wyoming Toad Safe Harbor Agreements (USFWS 2015). It is known from an elevation of 2,164 m asl (Green <em>et al. </em>2014).",There are no records of this species being utilized.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong><em>Conservation Actions In-Place</em></strong><br/>This species occurs within the Mortenson Lake National Wildlife Refuge, which encompasses four impoundments: Mortenson, Garber, Gibbs, and Soda lakes. The refuge is closed to the public (USFWS 2002e).&#160;Current management focuses on captive breeding and the release of larvae and toadlets at Mortenson Lake National Wildlife Refuge (USFWS 2002). Efforts are being made to establish additional suitable release sites on public lands and private lands protected through Safe Harbor Agreements (USFWS 2002).&#160;<em>Bd</em> (<em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>) surveillance and research is ongoing to understand disease dynamics in both the wild and captive population of Wyoming toads. This species is listed as Endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.&#160;<br/><strong><em><br/></em></strong><strong><em>Conservation Needed</em></strong><br/>It is recommended that for occupied lakes, emergent and bank vegetation (bulrushes, sedges, grasses, etc.) be managed through grazing, prescribed burning, and mechanical removal, etc. to prevent overgrown vegetation that inhibits the free movement of toads and could potentially alter the thermal environment. A continued focus on captive breeding is required, and it is recommended that awareness and communication programmes surrounding this species' be expanded.<br/><strong><em><br/></em></strong><strong><em>Research Needed</em></strong><br/>A better understanding of the life-history, disease dynamics, and ecological needs of the Wyoming Toad is necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the reintroduction program.

The first substantial report on its status in 1983 considered that its population was at least several hundred individuals (Limpus <em>et al</em>. 1983). It declined either gradually or episodically subsequently, although there were few and not very robust estimates of its status.

When this species was first discovered in 1957 the population consisted of 25 individuals (Gann 2015). The total population was fewer than 10 plants at the time of the final verified collection and sighting in 1964 (Gann 2015). Hurricane Donna in 1960 altered the conditions in the hammock where <em>G. floridana</em> was located (Luer 1972). This did not appear to initially have any impact on the existing plants, but it may have contributed to their subsequent decline. Removal of plants and trampling of the site by poachers was reported at the time of the final collection and likely constituted a threat to this species (Gann 2015). Attempts to rediscover <em>G. floridana</em> have been made throughout the hammock where it was once found, as well as in other hardwood hammocks on Big Pine Key with similar conditions, by multiple experts for many years (Gann <em>et al</em>. 2009, Gann 2015). While ephemeral in nature, it is large and distinctive both vegetatively and in flower and therefore probably not easily overlooked (Luer 1972, Brown 2000). Thus, having not been seen for 58 years despite these efforts, the available evidence suggests that this species is Extinct.<br/><br/>An Extinct assessment for this taxon is supported by application of the Records and Surveys Model, as outlined by&#160;Thompson<em>&#160;et al</em>. (2017). Applying the Records and Surveys Model gives a probability of extinction of 0.99. For the&#160; Threats Model, given the uncertainties about which threat(s) are responsible for the extinction of this species and how much of the range they affected, the maximum uncertainty was applied which resulted in a probability of extinction of 0.25. This meant that the combined results only gave an average probability of extinction of 0.62. However, the weighted averages result for the probability of extinction ranges from 0,9 to 0.99, hence the maximum probability gives the same result of EX, and is therefore considered to be acceptable.

In 1960 Hurricane Donna significantly altered conditions in the single hardwood hammock where this species occurred, increasing light penetration to the forest floor and causing an increase in understory vegetation. Altered conditions did not appear to have an immediate impact on the population of <em>Govenia floridana</em>, but may have contributed to its decline (Luer 1972).

This was a crepuscular and partially nocturnal lizard (Vaillant 1882), which preyed on bird eggs and fledglings (Hazevoet 1994). Animals would also scavenge dead birds (Hazevoet 1994). Females laid two eggs per clutch (Andreone and Guarino 2003). It is hypothesized that sexual maturity was reached at five (males) or six (females) years of age (Andreone and Guarino 2003), but age estimation in these lizards is uncertain and maturity may have been reached later. Sexual dimorphism was most pronounced after eight years.","Rats, cats and dogs have all been introduced to Santa Luzia, where they represented the major predators of this lizard (Andreone and Guarino 2003). As well as directly preying on the skink, rats and cats competed with them for food and may have caused declines in the seabird colonies on which this lizard relies. Particularly in times of drought, humans have also used the skink as a food source (Schleich 1982), for medicine and skins (Bocage 1873), and commercial trade for scientific purposes (Andreone and Guarino 2003). Low population numbers and recruitment, slow growth rates (Andreone and Guarino 2003), and a restricted range on a single island and two smaller islets all put this skink at extremely high risk from these threatening processes, as well as from stochastic events (particularly droughts, thought likely to have contributed to the species' extinction - Andreone<em> </em>2000), and it is now thought to be extinct.","This species was last seen alive in 1912, and has been considered extinct by some authors (e.g. Andreone and Guarino 2003) and in the First Red List of Cape Verde (Schleich 1996).

Vasconcelos pers. obs.).
